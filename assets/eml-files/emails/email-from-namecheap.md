Hello,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have carefully reviewed your inquiry regarding the subdomain blog.genderwatchdog.org and would like to provide the following information:

We confirm that there are currently no legal actions, court orders, or government requests associated with your domain. Please also note that any such request would typically apply to the entire domain, not to a specific subdomain.

DNS record modifications can only be made either by you (the domain owner) through your Namecheap account or by our team upon receipt of a confirmation code provided during verified support interactions. Therefore, you can rest assured that no DNS changes can occur without your authorization.

Upon checking the DNS settings, the CNAME record for the “blog” subdomain is currently propagating correctly. You may verify this independently using the following tool: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#CNAME/blog.genderwatchdog.org

This indicates that the subdomain name is resolving properly on the DNS level.

When attempting to access blog.genderwatchdog.org, the error message “This site can’t be reached. blog.genderwatchdog.org refused to connect” appears. This suggests that the issue is likely on the hosting provider’s side, rather than with the domain or DNS configuration.

Since your website content is hosted externally, we recommend contacting your hosting provider’s support team to review the site configuration, SSL/TLS settings, and ensure that your hosting endpoint is accepting connections from your custom domain.

If you need further assistance confirming your DNS configuration within Namecheap, please don’t hesitate to let us know, and we will be happy to assist.

Namecheap Team
