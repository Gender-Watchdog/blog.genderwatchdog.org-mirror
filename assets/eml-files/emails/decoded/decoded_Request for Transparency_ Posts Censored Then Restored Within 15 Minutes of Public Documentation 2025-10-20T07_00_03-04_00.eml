Dear
Substack Support,

On
October 20, 2025, at approximately 3:30 AM EST, two of our posts
became inaccessible: "APEC Leaders Will Meet in the Same City
Where Students Are Forced to Share Dorms with Tourists" "How
Korea Herald Failed to Cover Court-Confirmed Hate Crimes" Both
posts returned error pages stating "Substack is experiencing
technical problems" while your status page showed "All
Systems Operational" with 100% uptime. We confirmed the issue
across 2 PCs, 1 Android tablet with Substack app, and multiple
browsers. Within 10-25 minutes of documenting this publicly on X.com,
both posts were suddenly accessible again.

Timeline:
3:30 AM EST: Posts inaccessible ~5:30-5:45 AM EST: We document
censorship on
X.com: https://x.com/Gender_Watchdog/status/1980204224236626352 ~5:56
AM EST: Posts restored (noticed at 6:06 AM)

Total
censorship duration: ~2.5 hours Time from public documentation to
restoration: ~10-25 minutes This raises serious questions: How can
posts be inaccessible across multiple devices while status page shows
"operational"? This is technically impossible for a
platform-wide issue. Who was monitoring our X.com account at
5:30-6:00 AM on a Sunday morning? The 10-25 minute response time
proves active monitoring. Why did posts restore based on our X.com
documentation rather than platform status? If this was a technical
issue, it wouldn't resolve based on our public posts. Was this a
government-requested takedown that was reversed due to public
exposure?

Context
that makes this timing suspicious:

While
7 million Americans protested Trump at "No Kings" rallies
on October 19, calling him authoritarian and a threat to democracy,
Korea Herald reported the same day that Korea is considering awarding
Trump its highest
national honor -
the Grand Order of Mugunghwa - during his APEC
visit: https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10596516.
Korean business tycoons met with Trump at his Florida golf club on
October 18, briefing him on US investments.

This
exemplifies the institutional capture pattern we documented: Korean
institutions prioritizing prestige relationships and international
image over accountability. Korean press coverage shows the same
capture - Hankyoreh called America "marching toward fascism"
in September, then celebrated Korean deals with the same "fascist"
administration in October.

Our
censored posts documented this exact pattern: institutional capture
where prestige maintenance overrides governance substance. The timing
of censorship (7 days before APEC, after emailing delegations about
Korean institutional failures) suggests pressure to protect Korea's
international image during Trump's visit.

We
have preserved all evidence: Screenshots of error pages (3:30 AM)
Screenshot of status page showing "operational" Screenshots
of posts accessible again (~6:06 AM) X.com thread documentation with
timestamps: https://x.com/Gender_Watchdog/status/1980204224236626352 We
request transparency: Was this censorship intentional or accidental?
Who authorized the restoration at ~6:00 AM on Monday? Were you
monitoring our X.com account? Did you receive any government requests
regarding these posts? If we do not receive a substantive response
within 48 hours, we will publish a full transparency report
documenting: The technical impossibility of your "technical
problems" claim The 10-25 minute restoration timeline proving
active monitoring The timing (7 days before APEC, after sending
evidence to delegations) The pattern of institutional capture we've
been documenting This is a press freedom issue. We deserve
transparency about who is monitoring us and why.

regards,
