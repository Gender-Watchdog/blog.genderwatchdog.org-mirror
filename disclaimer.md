# Disclaimer: KWDI Report Analysis and Citation Clarification

**Timestamp Verification:** [Screenshot of creation time](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/disclaimer-time/disclaimer-time-screenshot.png?raw=true) *(time.gov timestamp at time of writing)*

## Important Clarification on Statistical References

Throughout our blog posts and resources across the internet, when we reference "from the 2020 KWDI report" regarding the 81/100 risk score for film departments, we want to clarify our methodology and ensure transparency.

### Current Status
Our analysis is **based on** the Korean Women's Development Institute's 2020 report titled "Current Status of Sexual Violence Against University Students in the Culture and Arts after the Me Too Movement and Policy Issues." When we cite specific risk scores, these represent **Gender Watchdog's analysis and interpretation** of the data and findings presented in the KWDI report, rather than direct statistical quotations.

### Terminology Transition
We are in the process of updating our language from:
- ❌ "from the 2020 KWDI report"

To the more precise:
- ✅ "based on Gender Watchdog's analysis of the 2020 KWDI report"

### Analytical Methodology
Our risk assessments and statistical interpretations are derived **in the spirit of** and **in line with** the KWDI report's findings and methodology. Following KWDI's methodological approach of analyzing interconnected academic-industry systems in Korean film, our analysis builds upon their research framework to assess institutional risk factors in Korean higher education, particularly in arts and film programs.

### Academic Integrity
We believe our analytical approach aligns with the KWDI report's findings and methodology, which may explain why the Korean Women's Development Institute has not contacted us regarding our citations. However, we are committed to academic transparency and precise attribution.

### Ongoing Updates
We are systematically updating our materials to reflect this clarification and ensure all future references properly attribute our analytical work while respecting the foundational research conducted by KWDI.
