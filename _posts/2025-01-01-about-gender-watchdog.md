> **Gender Watchdog** is an independent, anonymous public interest initiative committed to **gender equity**, **student safety**, and **ethical accountability** in global academic and cultural institutions.
>
> This project exists to:
>
> - Illuminate **structural vulnerabilities** in educational and cultural systems where **hierarchy** and **prestige** can obscure harm,
> - Promote **transparency** in faculty governance, festival gatekeeping, and institutional partnerships,
> - Uphold international protections such as **Title IX**, as well as ethical principles drawn from **human rights, civic responsibility**, and—where relevant—**religious or philosophical traditions**,
> - Encourage institutions to align their **public values** with their **internal practices**.
>
> Our work is grounded in:
>
> - **Publicly available information** (official websites, research publications, and public reports),
> - **Direct outreach** to stakeholders and partner institutions,
> - A sincere commitment to justice for students and survivors navigating closed systems.
>
> Where discrepancies arise—between **official branding** and **on-the-ground realities**—they are shared here as **invitations for public dialogue and institutional reflection**.
>
> 🕊️ *When an institution claims to stand for compassion, truth, or equality, our only question is: does it?*
