*The streaming giant's $2.5 billion Korean content investment faces significant compliance risks due to systemic issues in Korean film education*

## Key Findings

Our investigation into sexual violence in Korean film education has uncovered concerning Title IX compliance risks that extend to Netflix through their Korean content partnerships. These findings suggest Netflix could face reputational damage and legal liability in North America through their indirect association with institutions covering up sexual violence.

### Direct Title IX Exposure Through Korean Production Partners

Netflix's massive $2.5 billion investment in Korean content is potentially compromised through connections to institutions with documented sexual violence issues. The [Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI) research](https://drive.proton.me/urls/BAPF2DA400#4RGLR08iLFAJ) confirms that these problems affect **all** Korean universities with arts programs, not just Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents (our initial focus).

This means any of Netflix's Korean content partners with university affiliations represent potential Title IX compliance risks. [End Rape On Campus (EROC)](https://endrapeoncampus.org/), a leading U.S. Title IX advocacy organization, has formally endorsed our findings and activism.

### Statistical Evidence Reveals Systemic Problems

The scale of the problem is alarming:

- 61.5% of female arts students experience sexual violence across all Korean universities
- Film departments have the highest risk score (81/100) among all arts programs
- In high-risk departments like film, our analysis suggests the percentage of students affected could potentially approach 90-100%
- Netflix indirectly supports this ecosystem through partnerships with companies that collaborate with these institutions

The [Deun Deun Center for Gender Equality in Korean Film](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GXRANHYYJC#fz0SipRRWdaF) has documented rampant sexual violence in the industry, creating a continuum of abuse from education into professional settings.

## The Domino Effect for Netflix

What makes this particularly concerning for Netflix is the potential domino effect:

1. Once this information reaches internal legal and compliance teams, Netflix will be obligated to conduct partner risk disclosure reviews for **all Korean production partners**
2. These reviews will inevitably uncover connections to problematic institutions through internships, guest lectures, production placements, and collaborative projects
3. Under standard morals clauses and reputational risk provisions, Netflix could be contractually obligated to take action against affected production companies
4. This would create significant disruption to their multi-billion dollar Korean content investment strategy

## Beyond Dongguk: A Systemic Problem

Our investigation has documented a pattern across Korean arts academia, with numerous high-profile cases since 2016:

- Jo Min-ki (Cheongju University)
- Lee Yoon-taek (National Theatre Company)
- Korea National University of Arts
- Seoul Institute of the Arts
- Cho Jae-hyun (Kyungsung University)

Recent [academic research published in PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37788354/) has revealed the paradoxical finding that higher education levels make women MORE likely to experience sexual violence in Korea - not less. This counters traditional assumptions about education as a protective factor and highlights the unique dangers in Korean academic settings.

## Implications for Netflix

1. **Comprehensive Audit Required**: Netflix must audit all Korean content partners for university affiliations
2. **Reputational Risk**: Association with institutions covering up sexual violence threatens Netflix's brand
3. **Contractual Obligations**: Standard partner agreements likely require action once this information is formally received
4. **Investor Concerns**: ESG-focused investors may question Netflix's due diligence processes
5. **Consumer Backlash**: Growing awareness of production ethics could lead to boycotts or social media campaigns

## Additional Context: Public Funds Fraud

Our investigation has also uncovered potential misuse of public funds by Dongguk University through misrepresented international partnerships. Despite platform challenges—our X/Twitter account is under a shadow ban due to early account management missteps—our posts on this issue continue gaining traction, now exceeding 330 views after targeted outreach to key stakeholders.

Korean government agencies appear to be reviewing our evidence, particularly our findings that Dongguk claims 381 university partnerships while we've confirmed at least one is fabricated. This matters because Korean universities receive significant government funding based partly on international partnerships.

## A Leadership Opportunity

Netflix has an opportunity to lead reform in the Korean entertainment industry by addressing these issues proactively. By taking a stand for ethical content partnerships, Netflix can protect both its investments and its reputation while driving positive change in an industry desperately needing reform.
