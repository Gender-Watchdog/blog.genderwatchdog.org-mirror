**Jan 26, 2026**

If you try to visit Seoul National University's (SNU) "International Partners" page right now, you won't find it.

You will find a dead link. A timeout. A void.

But if you visit the main SNU homepage? It works perfectly. The admissions page? Fine. The donation page? Running smoothly.

Only one specific section of the "Harvard of Korea" has vanished: the database where they list their global friends.

**Why?**

Because we started asking who those friends actually are.

### The Timeline of Questionable Events
On January 21, 2026, we published a forensic alert on DC Inside titled *"Seoul National University Administration Worse than Inha University? The Ritsumeikan Mystery."*¹ This post exposed that while SNU lists Ritsumeikan University as a partner, Ritsumeikan's own database shows no student exchange agreement exists.

As of today, January 26, that post has garnered 111 industry-specific views and a recommendation on the student board.²

Five days later, the database is offline.

### A Coincidental Outage?
Following our exposure of Dongguk University's falsified partnership with UBC (which was removed from their site immediately after we flagged it), we are now observing anomalies at Seoul National University.

SNU's Office of International Affairs (`oia.snu.ac.kr`) is currently down.

![SNU OIA Website Connection Error](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/20260126-snu-scrub/snu-scrub-20260126/snu-partner-page-errors.png?raw=true)

![Wayback Machine Error](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/20260126-snu-scrub/snu-scrub-20260126/wayback-machine-snu-partner-page-failure-01262026.png?raw=true)

While technical maintenance is possible, the timing is notable—occurring shortly after we publicly questioned specific partnership claims on student forums. We are monitoring the situation to see if the database returns with the disputed entries intact.

We have previously noted that SNU listed Ritsumeikan University as a partner, while Ritsumeikan's own database did not reciprocate the student exchange agreement.

### The Submarine Connection
This matters because SNU is the crown jewel of the "Technical Talent" promise currently being sold to Canada in the Hanwha Ocean submarine deal.

If Korea's top university has unstable administrative systems preventing verification of partnerships, where is the talent coming from?

**We wait to see if the data returns unchanged.**

### UPDATE (Jan 28, 2026): The "Zombie" Database Returns
**Status:** Online.
**Verdict:** Fraudulent Entry Persists.

As of approx. 12:00 EST Jan 28, the `oia.snu.ac.kr` site has been restored.
We have verified that the **Ritsumeikan University** entry—which Ritsumeikan's own records do not reciprocate—remains listed.

**Analysis:**
The restoration of the site *without* correcting the data suggests a "Zombie" Strategy. Under pressure from high-level scrutiny (likely due to the current visits in Canada from Korean government officials and Hanwha executives), SNU has prioritized **uptime** over **integrity**. They cannot afford the optics of a "System Collapse," so they have re-animated a compromised database.

We forced them to blink. They chose to double down on the error rather than admit the flaw.

### UPDATE 2 (Jan 29, 2026): The "Frankenstein" Site (Botched Cover-up)
**Status:** Redirects Active.
**Tactic:** Interrupted Scrub / Attempted Liability Decoupling.

Following the "Zombie Restoration," SNU has executed a second evasive maneuver: **A Rename.**
The "Office of International Affairs" (OIA) has suddenly been rebranded to the "Office of Global Affairs" (OGA).

*   **Old URL:** `oia.snu.ac.kr` (Now 301 Redirects)
*   **New URL:** `oga.snu.ac.kr`

#### Strategic Analysis: The "Interrupted Scrub" Hypothesis
*Disclaimer: The following is a forensic analysis of the observed anomalies.*

While the rebranding to "Office of Global Affairs" (OGA) serves to distance the administration from the OIA's history (a tactic known as "Liability Decoupling"), the execution suggests something far more chaotic.

**The Smoking Gun:** The new OGA website still lists the falsified Ritsumeikan partnership.

**Why this indicates a "Botched Scrub":**
A standard, competent administrative rebrand would involve cleaning the dataset—specifically removing discrepancies like the Ritsumeikan entry—*before* migration. The fact that the site was offline for days and returned with a new name but the **same compromised data** suggests a rushed and sloppy process.

Furthermore, the blunt redirects (e.g., `oia.snu.ac.kr/outgoing-partnerships` redirecting to the OGA domain) without fixing the underlying data integrity issues reinforces the "Rushed Job" theory.

**The Timeline suggests:**
1.  **The Plan:** SNU took the site offline (Jan 26) to perform a "Lift and Shift"—rebranding to OGA and purging the falsified records simultaneously.
2.  **The Interruption:** Gender Watchdog's "Goes Dark" alert went viral, drawing immediate scrutiny to the downtime itself.
3.  **The Panic:** Realizing that extended downtime was being interpreted as an active cover-up, administrators were forced to bring the systems back online immediately.
4.  **The Result:** They succeeded in changing the name (OGA), but ran out of time to scrub the data.

We are looking at a **"Frankenstein" site**: A new brand stitching together the old, corrupt database. This indicates an administration operating in panic mode, prioritizing optics over integrity, and failing at both.

They changed the sign on the door, but forgot to clean the crime scene.

**Visual Evidence of the Switch:**

1. **The Redirect in Action:**
A Google search for the old "International Partners" page now redirects to the new OGA domain. Notice that Google still indexes the `oia.snu.ac.kr` subdomain, but users are sent to `oga.snu.ac.kr`.

**Redirected URLs (Sloppy Migration):**
We verified that the following specific URLs, visible in search results, now bluntly redirect to the OGA homepage instead of their correct deep-link destinations:
*   `https://oia.snu.ac.kr/outgoing-partnerships`
*   `http://oia.snu.ac.kr/partner-universities-program`
*   Target: `https://oga.snu.ac.kr/`

### UPDATE 3 (Jan 29, 2026): The Censorship (Streisand Effect)
**Status:** Original Whistleblower Post Deleted.
**Tactic:** Evidence Suppression.

Simultaneously with the website rebrand, **the original forensic alert posted on the DC Inside SNU Student Gallery has been deleted.**

The post titled *"Seoul National University Administration Worse than Inha University? The Ritsumeikan Mystery"* (ID: 234659) is no longer accessible on the board.

**Why delete it?**
Because it contained the primary evidence of the Ritsumeikan discrepancy that sparked the audit. By deleting the student discussion, they attempt to erase the "origin" of the controversy.

**The Archives Remain:**
We anticipated this censorship. The post is permanently archived.

*   **Deleted Source Context:** [SNU Student Gallery Board](https://gall.dcinside.com/board/lists/?id=seouluniversity&page=1)
*   **Archive 1 (Archive.md):** [View Snapshot](https://archive.md/vieGw)
*   **Archive 2 (Megalodon):** [View Snapshot](https://megalodon.jp/2026-0121-1734-38/https://gall.dcinside.com:443/board/view/?id=seouluniversity&no=234659)

### UPDATE 4 (Feb 5, 2026): The "Soft 404" & Zombie Persistence
**Status:** Redirect Anomaly Detected / Visual Confirmation.
**Tactic:** "Link Rot" Strategy & Backend Stagnation.

We have detected a sophisticated "Soft 404" redirect strategy designed to break forensic deep links while maintaining surface-level uptime.

**The Evidence (Visual Ping Analysis):**
New Visual Ping analysis confirms that the specific deep link to the falsified partner page no longer redirects to the equivalent page on the new site.

**The Technical Breakdown:**
*   **Old Forensic Link:** `https://oia.snu.ac.kr/outgoing-partnerships?field_region_target_id=22&page=3` (Where we found the Ritsumeikan lie).
*   **The "Lazy" Redirect:** `https://oga.snu.ac.kr/?field_region_target_id=22&page=3` (Redirects to Homepage + Generic Params).
*   **The Actual New Location:** `https://oga.snu.ac.kr/outgoing-partnerships?field_region_target_id=22&page=3` (Where the lie still exists).

**Why This Matters:**
If this were a competent migration, the **Old Link** would automatically forward to the **Actual New Location**. Instead, it dumps users on the homepage, effectively "scrubbing" the evidence from direct access without triggering a "404 Not Found" error.

> "The old Partnerships table and related navigation were removed. The page now shows a global affairs header with a hero area and an appointment widget, along with updated navigation." — *Visual Ping Change Summary*

**Visual Confirmation:**
![Visual Ping Redirect Analysis](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/20260126-snu-scrub/snu-scrub-20260126/update4/visual-ping-snu-redirect-with-params.png?raw=true)

**Strategic Analysis: Weaponized Incompetence**
This configuration exhibits the hallmarks of a "Lazy Root" redirect, effectively scrubbing the evidence from direct access without returning a suspicious "404 Not Found" error. Users are simply dumped on the front page, confused.

![SNU Redirect Destination](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/20260126-snu-scrub/snu-scrub-20260126/update4/snu-redirect-dest-02052026.png?raw=true)

However, the **Zombie Entry** persists. We verified that the falsified Ritsumeikan partnership *still exists* on the new `oga.snu.ac.kr` database (accessible only if you navigate manually). This confirms a "Lift and Shift" migration: SNU changed the name on the door (OIA -> OGA) but refused to clean the corruption inside the house.
