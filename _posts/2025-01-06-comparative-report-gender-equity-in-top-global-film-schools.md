## Highlights and Contrasts

### USC School of Cinematic Arts
- **Dean:** Elizabeth Daley (female, since 1991)
- **Equity Structures:** Title IX, Diversity Council
- **Student Groups:** Women in Cinematic Arts (WCA), Feminist Media Festival

### NYU Tisch School of the Arts
- **Dean:** Allyson Green (female)
- **Equity Structures:** Title IX; EDI Task Forces; internal complaint portals
- **Student Groups:** Fusion Film Festival for women in film/TV
- **Contrast:** Strong visibility and institutional support for women, unlike Dongguk’s muted presence.

### Columbia University School of the Arts
- **Dean:** Carol Becker (2007–2023); interim female successor
- **Equity Structures:** Gender-Based Misconduct Office, required annual training
- **Student Participation:** Female-led productions; interdisciplinary arts council
- **Contrast:** Strong faculty gender balance and formal policy enforcement; absent in Dongguk's grad program.

### La Fémis (Paris)
- **Director:** Nathalie Coste-Cerdan (female)
- **Policy:** Charter for Gender Equality; mandatory equity statistics tracking
- **Student Representation:** Parity in admissions and governing councils
- **Contrast:** Proactive parity policies and public accountability lacking at Dongguk.

### NFTS (UK)
- **Director:** Jon Wardle (male); Board formerly chaired by Dame Dawn Airey
- **Equity Structures:** Equality Act; scholarships for women
- **Student Body:** Near 50/50 gender ratio
- **Contrast:** Transparency and reform-oriented culture far ahead of Dongguk.

### Tokyo University of the Arts
- **Faculty Ratio:** Majority male; reform underway
- **Policy:** National harassment consultation process; EGSA guidelines
- **Student Body:** Often majority female in animation/media
- **Contrast:** Cultural similarity to Dongguk, but public reform measures present.

## Conclusion
Most globally recognized film schools have adopted:
- **Formal grievance channels** (Title IX, Equality Act, Gender Offices)
- **Female leadership in governance or faculty**
- **Student-led equity initiatives** (festivals, councils, scholarships)

In contrast, Dongguk University’s Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents:
- Lacks visible female leadership
- Lacks public reform commitments
- Has limited or abolished female student representation (e.g., female student council)

These gaps indicate systemic vulnerability and reputational risk for Dongguk as global norms shift toward transparency and equity. The roadmap is clear: gender equity improves academic outcomes for all students, including male learners. Reform is not just ethical—it is strategically necessary.
