# Why We Migrated: Domain Blocking 48 Hours Before APEC Economic Leaders' Week in Gyeongju, Korea

**October 25, 2025** — We noticed that our custom domain `blog.genderwatchdog.org` stopped resolving globally at approximately 12:34 PM KST today. The timing is not coincidental: **48 hours before APEC Economic Leaders' Week begins in Gyeongju, South Korea**—the same city where we documented student exploitation at Dongguk University's WISE campus.

This post documents the censorship attempt, our migration to more resilient infrastructure, and why this makes our work **stronger**, not weaker.

## What Happened

### Timeline

**April 2025 onwards**: Published comprehensive documentation of:
- Falsified university partnerships (40% fraud rate with Canadian institutions)
- Sexual violence cover-ups (KWDI 2020: 61.5% of female arts students experience harassment)
- Corporate-academic exploitation (entertainment CEOs appointed as faculty over students)
- Gyeongju campus exploitation (students sharing "housing" with tourists)

**6+ months**: Custom domain operated without any technical issues

**October 25, 2025, ~12:34 AM KST**: Custom domain stopped resolving globally
- DNS records unchanged at registrar (Namecheap)
- No legal requests received according to registrar
- No court orders
- No government notices
- Bear Blog dashboard suddenly shows "DNS not set" despite 6 months of proper operation

**October 27-November 1, 2025**: APEC Economic Leaders' Week in Gyeongju
- Same city where we documented ongoing exploitation
- International scrutiny at peak levels
- Evidence packages prepared for APEC delegations
- Perfect timing for suppression

### Technical Evidence

We immediately documented:
- ✅ DNS records unchanged at Namecheap
- ✅ Registrar confirmation: "No legal actions, court orders, or government requests"
- ✅ Content still accessible at direct URL: `genderwatchdog.bearblog.dev`
- ✅ Global DNS failure (not regional or ISP-specific)
- ✅ No technical explanation for sudden "DNS not set" status

**This is not a technical issue. This is targeted interference.**

#### Evidence Screenshots

**1. Third-party confirmation of outage (00:47 AM KST):**

## Why the Timing Matters

### The APEC Connection

**What is APEC?**
- Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
- 21 member economies representing 60% of global GDP
- Leaders' Week is the year's most important diplomatic event for host country

**Why Gyeongju?**
- Official APEC Leaders' Week location: October 27-November 1, 2025
- Our documented exploitation: Dongguk WISE campus in **same city**
- Our evidence: Students forced to share "student housing" with tourists
- Our documentation: Campus president under criminal prosecution

**What we prepared:**
- Evidence packages for APEC delegations
- On-site verification information
- Documentation of ongoing exploitation
- Timeline showing 190+ days of institutional silence

**When domain was blocked:**
- **48 hours before APEC begins**
- Exactly when international delegations arrive in Gyeongju
- Perfect timing to suppress information about local institutional failures
- Surgical suppression during peak international scrutiny

### The Pattern

This isn't isolated:

1. **April 2025**: We publish documentation → Institutions remain silent
2. **May 2025**: Sidus FNH (entertainment company) sends legal threats → We document and continue
3. **190+ days**: Canadian embassy, Korean government, university maintain silence
4. **October 23, 2025**: APEC delegations begin arriving in Gyeongju
5. **October 25, 2025**: Our domain suddenly stops working
6. **October 27, 2025**: APEC officially begins with international media present

The suppression attempt correlates **exactly** with the moment when our documentation would receive maximum international visibility in the specific location we documented.

## Why We Chose GitHub Pages

### The Censorship Resistance Hierarchy

**Bear Blog (Small indie hosting):**
- ✅ Excellent for starting out
- ✅ Simple, clean, fast
- ❌ Small scale = easy to pressure quietly
- ❌ One developer (Herman) has limited resources to fight back
- ❌ No PR risk for suppressing one site

**GitHub Pages (Microsoft infrastructure):**
- ✅ $2+ trillion company with 100+ million users
- ✅ Any censorship becomes tech news instantly
- ✅ Public legal process required (DMCA transparency)
- ✅ Counter-notification rights protected
- ✅ Geopolitical leverage
- ✅ Streisand effect: Takedowns amplify the story

### What Censors Now Face

**Before (Bear Blog):**
- Quiet pressure possible
- No public record required
- Limited visibility
- Easy suppression

**Now (GitHub Pages):**
- Must pressure **Microsoft**, not individual developer
- Requires **public legal process** (GitHub transparency reports)
- Triggers **tech community response** (Hacker News, Reddit, tech press)
- Creates **international news**: "Microsoft pressured to censor sexual violence documentation"
- **Proves systematic censorship attempts** through public legal process
- Becomes **more expensive** politically than ignoring us

### The Microsoft Factor

GitHub is owned by Microsoft. Censoring content on GitHub Pages means:
- Targeting a US company with massive geopolitical leverage
- Creating precedent that affects thousands of projects globally
- Generating immediate tech industry backlash
- Confirming censorship allegations in most visible way possible

**Any takedown attempt now requires:**
1. Valid legal basis (not just "we don't like this")
2. Public documentation via GitHub transparency reports
3. International legal process (US courts, not just Korean)
4. Consequences for false DMCA claims
5. Counter-notification process

**This is exactly what censors wanted to avoid.**

## What This Migration Proves

### Censorship Attempt = Evidence

The migration itself documents:

1. **Institutional panic**: Why else block a domain 48 hours before APEC?
2. **Coordination**: Timing this precise requires planning
3. **Intent**: Suppressing information during diplomatic event
4. **Confirmation**: Everything we documented about institutional capture is validated

**The censorship attempt is now part of the evidence.**

### Strategic Strength

**Before:**
- "We document institutional failures in Korea"

**Now:**
- "We document institutional failures in Korea **AND survived targeted censorship 48 hours before APEC**"

**We just got stronger, not weaker.**

### Multiple Mirrors = Resilience

We now maintain:
1. **Primary**: `blog.genderwatchdog.org` (GitHub Pages) ← **You are here**
2. **Mirror**: `genderwatchdog.bearblog.dev` (Bear Blog)
3. **Timeline**: `genderwatchdog.org` (GitHub)
4. **Evidence**: `github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025`

If they take down GitHub, that requires:
- Public legal process
- International news coverage
- Confirmation of censorship
- Proof of institutional panic

**Each suppression attempt makes the story bigger.**

## What We're Doing Now

### Documentation

1. **This post**: Public record of censorship attempt
2. **Technical logs**: DNS records, registrar confirmations, timestamps
3. **Screenshots**: Working site → blocked domain → restored on GitHub
4. **Timeline**: Correlation analysis with APEC schedule
5. **Correspondence**: Letters to EFF, RSF, press freedom organizations

### Notifications

Sent evidence packages to:
- Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
- Reporters Without Borders (RSF)
- Tech press contacts
- Press freedom organizations
- Academic freedom advocates
- International student safety organizations

### Transparency

All documentation:
- Posted publicly on this site
- Archived in evidence repository
- Shared with press freedom organizations
- Made available to journalists
- Preserved for potential litigation

**We're not hiding. We're documenting.**

## Why Censorship Failed

### The Streisand Effect

By blocking our domain, they:
1. Confirmed our documentation is accurate (why else suppress?)
2. Created news story: Censorship attempt itself
3. Generated international interest: APEC timing too obvious
4. Forced migration to more resilient infrastructure
5. Made suppression more expensive going forward

**Quiet suppression is now impossible.**

### Tech Community Support

Response from tech community:
- DNS propagation monitoring
- Archive.org backups
- Mirror hosting offers
- Legal resource referrals
- Documentation assistance

**We're not alone.**

### Institutional Validation

The censorship attempt validates:
- Our methodology (they fear accurate documentation)
- Our timing (APEC correlation proves sensitivity)
- Our impact (wouldn't suppress if ineffective)
- Our concerns (institutional capture confirmed by behavior)

**Actions speak louder than denials.**

---

## What This Means for Survivors

### Silencing Pattern

**What they wanted:**
- Quiet suppression during APEC
- No international scrutiny in Gyeongju
- Victims' testimonies disappear
- Documentation becomes inaccessible
- Institutional failures hidden from delegations

**What they got:**
- Public censorship documentation
- International press freedom advocacy
- More resilient infrastructure
- Confirmation of institutional panic
- Amplified visibility

### Protection Through Transparency

**Survivors who shared testimonies on our platform:**

You are not silenced. Your stories are:
- Preserved in multiple archives
- Documented publicly
- Shared with advocacy organizations
- Protected by censorship-resistant infrastructure
- Validated by institutional reaction

**The censorship attempt proves your stories matter.**

### Continued Documentation

We continue to document:
- Sexual violence in Korean universities
- Institutional cover-ups
- Falsified partnerships
- Corporate-academic exploitation
- Government complicity
- Press failures
- Diplomatic silence

**Now from infrastructure they can't quietly suppress.**

## Lessons for Other Activists

### Infrastructure Matters

**Don't wait for censorship to start:**
1. Use censorship-resistant infrastructure from day one
2. Maintain multiple mirrors automatically
3. Document everything publicly
4. Build relationships with press freedom orgs
5. Understand legal protections in different jurisdictions

**GitHub Pages advantages:**
- Free hosting
- Custom domains supported
- HTTPS automatic
- Public legal process required for takedowns
- Tech community monitoring
- Geopolitical complexity for censors

### Documentation Protects

**What saved us:**
- Immediate technical documentation
- Public transparency about suppression
- Evidence preservation
- Press freedom organization contacts
- Community support networks

**What makes censorship expensive:**
- Public record of attempts
- Technical proof of interference
- Timing analysis showing coordination
- International advocacy connections
- Platform transparency requirements

### The Paradox of Suppression

**Every censorship attempt:**
- Validates the documentation
- Amplifies the message
- Expands the audience
- Proves institutional guilt
- Creates news stories
- Builds solidarity

**Censorship is evidence.**

---

## Message to Institutions

### You Made It Worse

**Before the censorship attempt:**
- We were documenting institutional failures
- Reaching existing audience
- Operating quietly and methodically
- Building evidence systematically

**After the censorship attempt:**
- We're documenting institutional failures **AND censorship**
- Reaching press freedom organizations globally
- Operating on infrastructure you can't quietly suppress
- With evidence that includes your suppression attempt

**You validated everything we documented.**

### The Inevitable Documentation

Every action you take is documented:
- Legal threats → Archived and published
- Domain blocking → Technical logs preserved
- APEC timing → Correlation analysis public
- Government silence → 190+ days documented
- Press complicity → Coverage gaps tracked

**You can't suppress what's already preserved in multiple locations.**

### What Accountability Looks Like

We're not going anywhere. This site now operates on:
- ✅ Microsoft infrastructure (harder target)
- ✅ With public legal oversight (transparency required)
- ✅ International press freedom backing (advocacy support)
- ✅ Tech community monitoring (suppression becomes news)
- ✅ Multiple mirrors (resilience built-in)

**Accountability is now censorship-resistant.**

---

## Moving Forward

### What Hasn't Changed

- Documentation continues
- Evidence preservation ongoing
- Survivor support maintained
- International advocacy active
- Multiple mirrors operational

### What Has Changed

- **Infrastructure**: More resilient
- **Visibility**: Higher (censorship attempt is news)
- **Support**: Expanded (press freedom orgs engaged)
- **Protection**: Stronger (legal oversight required)
- **Validation**: Confirmed (institutional panic proves accuracy)

### What's Next

1. **Continue documentation** of institutional failures
2. **Expand evidence** packages for APEC delegations (now with censorship docs)
3. **Collaborate** with press freedom organizations
4. **Support survivors** sharing testimonies
5. **Document** any additional censorship attempts
6. **Build** more resilient infrastructure for activist journalism

## Conclusion: Censorship as Validation

**They tried to silence us 48 hours before APEC.**

**Instead, they:**
- Confirmed our documentation is accurate
- Created an international censorship story
- Forced us onto more resilient infrastructure
- Validated institutional panic
- Proved systematic suppression

**The censorship attempt is now part of the evidence.**

We're now on infrastructure that requires public legal process for any takedown. We have press freedom organizations monitoring. We have tech community support. We have multiple mirrors.

**Every suppression attempt from here requires:**
- Public documentation
- International legal process
- Geopolitical consequences
- Tech industry scrutiny
- Confirmation of everything we've documented

**You made us stronger.**
