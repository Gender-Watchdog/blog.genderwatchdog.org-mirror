---

**Feb 23, 2026**

On October 28, 2025, Tu Anh—a 25-year-old graduate of Keimyung University—fell to her death fleeing an immigration raid at a car parts factory in Daegu.

She was not a criminal. She was a scholar. A graduate of the Department of International Commerce.
She was working in a factory because her "Global Degree" failed to secure her a visa.

We believe she is the first documented victim of **Lethal Consumer Fraud** in the Korean Higher Education market. And the ranking organizations that validated her university are complicit.

### The "Global" Trap

Keimyung University markets itself aggressively as a global hub. Their website lists hundreds of international partnerships, painting a picture of a degree that is a passport to the world.
We have the list. We are auditing it.
(See: *Keimyung Partnership Database Audit - Pending*)

**The Promise:** Enroll here, pay tuition, and join the global economy.
**The Reality:** According to the *Korea Herald*, only **10%** of foreign bachelor’s degree holders in Korea manage to secure an E-7 professional visa.<sup>1</sup>

The other 90%? They are trapped. Abandoned by the universities that recruited them, forced into the shadows of the D-10 "Job Seeker" visa, and pushed into illegal factory work to survive.

### QS Rankings: Valuating the Trap

Why did Tu Anh choose Keimyung? Likely because of its reputation—a reputation bolstered by organizations like **QS (Quacquarelli Symonds)** and **Times Higher Education (THE)**.

These organizations assign points for "International Outlook." They validate the university's claims of being "Global."
*   If Keimyung's partner list is inflated with "Ghost Partnerships" (as we found at Dongguk and SNU), then QS sold Tu Anh a lie.
*   They certified a lemon. And when that vehicle failed, the driver died.

### The Corporate Panic (Traffic Evidence)

We know the industry is terrified of this connection.
In the days following our exposure of "Partnership Fraud" at Dongguk and SNU, our traffic logs have shown unusual activity from **Hong Kong** and **Singapore** (the Asian legal hubs for these ranking agencies).

While we cannot definitively attribute this traffic, we have observed hundreds of 0-second visits day after day from February 2 to February 22, 2026. This pattern began shortly after we emailed a warning to QS in January stating that we are consulting with legal clinics.

**Traffic Data Availability:**
*The raw traffic data (downloadable .zip collection of .csv files for the requested date range) is available upon request for verification purposes. Please contact: genderwatchdog@proton.me*

They are not just checking our posts. They are reviewing our findings on **Consumer Fraud** regarding the validation of Korean universities with widespread partner falsifications and sexual violence cover-ups.
They know what we know: **The degree was the trap.**

### A Call to Action

To the **Daegu-Gyeongbuk Committee for Justice for Tu Anh** and her father, **Mr. Vu Van Sung**:
Do not just accept an apology for the raid.
**Audit the degree.**

If Keimyung University sold a "Global Education" based on falsified data, this is not just an accident. It is **Wrongful Death via Consumer Fraud**.

### Update (Feb 8): The "Prestige Gap" Exposed
Our manual audit has confirmed a disturbing pattern we call "Tier Fraud." Keimyung University *does* have some real partners, but they are mid-tier institutions. The "Elite" partners—the ones that sell the dream—are ghosts.

*   **Real:** Shandong University, Sichuan University (Mid-tier).
*   **Fake:** Fudan University, Sun Yat-sen University, Beijing Foreign Studies University (Elite).

**Evidence: The "Phantom" Elite Partnerships**

Keimyung claims them, but they do not claim Keimyung.

**1. Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU)**
Keimyung lists BFSU as a partner in Asia.

Reality: BFSU's own partner list includes many Korean universities (Hanyang, HUFS, Inha, Ewha, etc.), but **Keimyung is missing**.
![BFSU Partner List Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/master/imgs/fake-partners/keimyung-not-listed-elite-china/keimyung-not-listed-bfsu.png)

**2. Fudan University**
Keimyung lists Fudan University.
![Keimyung lists Fudan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/master/imgs/fake-partners/keimyung-not-listed-elite-china/keimyung-fudan-listed.png)

Reality: Fudan's list includes Seoul National, Yonsei, Korea Univ, Ewha, etc., but **Keimyung is missing**.
![Fudan Partner List No Keimyung](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/master/imgs/fake-partners/keimyung-not-listed-elite-china/keimyung-not-on-fudan.png)

**3. Sun Yat-sen University**
Keimyung lists Sun Yat-sen University.
![Keimyung lists Sun Yat-sen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/master/imgs/fake-partners/keimyung-not-listed-elite-china/keimyung-lists-sun-yat-sen.png)

Reality: Sun Yat-sen lists Chung-Ang, Korea Univ, SNU, Yonsei, etc., but **Keimyung is missing**.
![Sun Yat-sen Partner List No Keimyung](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/master/imgs/fake-partners/keimyung-not-listed-elite-china/keimyung-sun-yatsen-not-listed.png)

**Conclusion:** Keimyung is using valid mid-tier partnerships to cover for the fabrication of elite-tier connections. They are selling a "Fudan-level" network on a "local university" budget.

We are seeing traffic from Singapore, HK, and the USA—forensics indicate this is likely QS's legal team preparing a defense. We are working with EROC and preparing submissions to global legal clinics regarding Consumer Fraud and Complicity in Human Trafficking.
