In 2007, **Dongguk University** drew international attention over a scandal that would come to be known as **"Shingate."** At its center was **Shin Jeong-ah** , a professor hired in 2005 to teach art history based on what was later discovered to be a **forged Yale University Ph.D.**

Despite internal doubts, Dongguk proceeded with her hire. Crucially, the university had received a **faxed confirmation** from Yale â€” later revealed to be sent in error â€” that verified Shin's claimed credentials. When the controversy resurfaced in 2007, Yale initially denied having sent the confirmation, only to later acknowledge it had made a mistake.

Dongguk, facing reputational fallout, filed a **$50 million defamation lawsuit** in U.S. federal court. The university claimed that Yale's error damaged its ability to attract **government grants, alumni donations, and support for a new law school** initiative [1](https://yalealumnimagazine.org/articles/2051-korean-university-sues-yale-for-50-million).

The court dismissed the case. In 2013, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that Dongguk **failed to prove actual malice or causation of damages** , and Yale was not held liable [2](https://casetext.com/case/dongguk-univ-v-yale-univ).

## From Legal Accountability to Institutional Responsibility

What this episode demonstrated is that Dongguk University clearly **understands how the U.S. legal system works**. It understands that:

  * **Academic integrity** matters.
  * **Institutional reputation** is shaped by how wrongdoing is handled.
  * U.S. legal channels exist not only to protect reputations, but also to demand accountability.



Yet today, more than a decade after the Shingate lawsuit, Dongguk faces renewed scrutiny â€” not over a forged degree, but over its **handling of sexual violence risk, gender equity, and institutional transparency**.

## A Growing Concern: Structural Risks in Film Education

At the time of writing, Dongguk University:

  * Has **no female faculty** in its **Graduate School of Film and Digital Media** , despite its co-educational enrollment.
  * Maintains **close relationships with production companies** , such as **Sidus FNH** , that **share building space** with graduate classrooms â€” without clear firewalls, independent oversight, or trusted reporting mechanisms for abuse.
  * Has **not implemented Title IX-aligned protections** for its own students â€” despite having **ongoing academic partnerships with U.S. and Canadian institutions** , whose students may be put at similar risk abroad.



These issues matter because **Title IX** , passed in the U.S. in 1972, guarantees that **students in educational institutions must not face discrimination on the basis of sex** â€” including **sexual violence, coercion, or abuse by faculty or affiliated personnel**.

* * *

## The Double Standard

> Dongguk University was willing to invoke U.S. legal protections when its **reputation and funding were on the line**.

But now, when **U.S. values** â€” like **gender equity, anti-harassment measures, and student safeguards** â€” are relevant to how it manages its own programs, the university has gone quiet.

This isn't just a legal oversight. It's a case of **selective institutional ethics**.

* * *

## The Irony: Reputational Harm Then â€” And Now

In its lawsuit against Yale, Dongguk claimed the "Shingate" incident caused it to lose credibility, threatening its ability to secure **alumni donations, charitable gifts, and institutional growth**.

But today, it is knowingly ignoring **documented structural vulnerabilities for sexual violence** â€” vulnerabilities that carry **far greater reputational and legal risk** than the forgery scandal ever did.

> The reputational harm they once feared was hypothetical.  
>  The reputational harm they now face is real â€” and global.  
>  And this time, **they cannot blame anyone else**.

* * *

## Time to Reaffirm Core Values

As this international advocacy campaign gathers momentum, Dongguk University must ask itself:

  * Will it **modernize its hiring practices** to reflect gender balance and fair representation?
  * Will it **establish independent, transparent structures** to address sexual violence and misconduct â€” especially where academic and industry lines blur?
  * Will it **live up to the same standards of integrity and accountability** it once expected from others?



The legacy of Shingate should have been about **learning from institutional failure**.

If Dongguk continues to evade necessary reform, the message is clear:  
**It has learned nothing at all.**
