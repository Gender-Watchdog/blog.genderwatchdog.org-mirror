**[Breaking News]** The "Global Dongguk" brand is built on a foundation of sand.

Following our exposure of falsified partnerships in Canada and the UK, a comprehensive audit of Dongguk University's "Global Partners" list has revealed a systematic pattern of deception we are calling **"Semantic Fraud."**

From China to Oceania, from "Public Ivies" to the Russell Group, we have now identified **34 institutions** that Dongguk claims as partners but who either deny the relationship entirely or restrict it so severely that calling it a "partnership" is misleading.

This is not just an administrative error. It is a cover-up.

## What is "Semantic Fraud"?

Dongguk University appears to be exploiting the ambiguity between different types of academic agreements to inflate its global status:

1.  **The MOU Trap:** Signing a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) — often just a "let's be friends" letter — and listing it as a full student exchange partnership.
2.  **Zombie Partnerships:** Continuing to list universities as partners years after the agreement has expired (e.g., Wuhan University).
3.  **The "Departmental" Switch:** A specific department (e.g., Engineering) has a small agreement, but Dongguk lists the entire university as a partner, misleading students from other majors.
4.  **Outright Fabrication:** Listing universities that have no record of any agreement whatsoever.

## 1. The China Cluster: State Media Duped

Our investigation into Chinese partnerships revealed that even major institutions and state media have been misled.

### The "Smoking Gun": Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)
We received a direct reply from BIT's International Student Center regarding their status with Dongguk.

> **"您好！我是北京理工大学留学生中心[Name Redacted]。我校与东国大学已签署MOU。特此说明。"**
> *(Hello! This is [Name Redacted] from the BIT International Student Center. Our university has signed an MOU with Dongguk University. This is to clarify.)*

**The Catch:** While they have an MOU, BIT **does not list Dongguk** on their official partner list for student exchange. Dongguk uses this "piece of paper" to claim a full partnership, deceiving students into thinking they can study there.

### Wuhan University: Time Travel
Dongguk seems to be relying on a webpage from **2014** to claim a partnership with Wuhan University.
*   **2014 Legacy Page:** Lists Dongguk.
*   **2024 Official Page:** **Dongguk is gone.**

![Wuhan University 2014 Legacy Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gender-Watchdog/blog.genderwatchdog.org-mirror/master/assets/images/dongguk-fake-partners/china/wuhan-dongguk-yes-2014.png)

*Above: The reality in 2024.*

### Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU)
BFSU lists 13 Korean partners. Dongguk is not one of them. Yet, Dongguk claims them. <sup>25</sup>

### Tsinghua University & China Daily
Even *China Daily* reported on a "MOU signing" between Tsinghua and Dongguk. But does Tsinghua's official exchange office recognize this as a university-wide partnership? The evidence suggests otherwise. State media should not be used to launder the reputation of a university that falsifies its international standing.

### Additional Chinese Universities
*   **Peking University:** No Dongguk.

*   **Harbin Institute of Technology:** No Dongguk.

## 2. The Oceania Collapse: 85% Fake

Our audit of the Oceania region (Australia/New Zealand) was even more shocking. Of the 7 partners Dongguk claims:
*   **Confirmed Real:** 1 (Charles Sturt University)
*   **Confirmed Fake/Missing:** 5
*   **Likely Fake (Name Error):** 1

**That is an 85% failure rate.**

### The "University of West Sydney" Error
Dongguk lists a partner called **"University of West Sydney."**
**Fact Check:** There is no such university in Australia. The correct name is **"Western Sydney University."**
When a university doesn't even know the correct name of its alleged partner, it is a strong indicator that the partnership does not exist. The link provided by Dongguk leads to a 404 error.

### Confirmed "No" from Oceania
*   **Victoria University of Wellington (NZ):** Lists SNU, Korea Univ, but **NO Dongguk**. <sup>20</sup>

## 3. Global Top Tier: The Rejection Continues

The pattern repeats across the globe. Prestigious universities that Dongguk claims as partners do not list Dongguk.

*   **UCLA (USA):** No. <sup>1</sup>

## 4. Caveats and Restrictions: The "Departmental" Switch

Dongguk often claims a university-wide partnership when the agreement is actually limited to a specific department or program.

*   **Lund University (Sweden):** Faculty of Engineering (LTH) only. No Humanities. <sup>12</sup>
    ![Lund Engineering Only](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gender-Watchdog/blog.genderwatchdog.org-mirror/master/assets/images/dongguk-fake-partners/europe/lund-engineering-only-dongguk.png)

## 5. Japan Audit: More Rejections

*   **Ritsumeikan University:** No. <sup>17</sup>

## The Walls Are Closing In: International Legal Escalation

Dongguk's strategy of silence is failing as international partners escalate our inquiries into formal legal and regulatory matters.

1.  **Canada (UBC): Regulatory Intervention**
    After UBC initially delayed, the **BC Information & Privacy Commissioner (OIPC)** intervened, ordering a response. This proves that "ghosting" inquiries triggers regulatory oversight.

2.  **UK (University of Southampton): Voluntary FOI Escalation**
    In a significant move, the University of Southampton **voluntarily forwarded** our inquiry to their Freedom of Information office (Ref: F-25-0507). They are not treating this as a simple email query; they are treating it as a formal legal matter.

3.  **China (BIT): The "Semantic" Confession**
    Beijing Institute of Technology didn't just ignore us. They replied to confirm the exact mechanism of the fraud: "We have an MOU" (the paper) but "No Partnership" (the reality).

**The message to Dongguk is clear:** You can hide from students, but you cannot hide from the Freedom of Information Acts of the UK and Canada, nor the internal audits of Chinese state universities.

### Evidence Downloads (Redacted for Privacy)

Transparency is key. We are releasing redacted FOI responses confirming the lack of partnerships.

*Unredacted versions available to credentialed press, journalists, ranking organizations, and government officials upon request.*

## The Coupang Parallel: Cover-Up Culture

South Korea is currently in an uproar over **Coupang**, the e-commerce giant, for hiding a massive data breach to protect its stock price and U.S. investors. <sup>26</sup>

Dongguk University is following the exact same playbook.
*   **Coupang:** Hid data leaks to protect stock price.
*   **Dongguk:** Hides fake partnerships to protect university rankings.

In both cases, the institution prioritizes its external image over the rights and safety of its stakeholders (customers/students).

## The Consequences: Delisting and Lawsuits

This is not a victimless crime.

1.  **Ranking Delisting (The KAIST Precedent):**
    KAIST was recently excluded from the QS World University Rankings for manipulating survey data. Dongguk's falsification of **dozens** of international partnerships—a key metric for "International Outlook"—is a far more severe violation. We are submitting this evidence to QS, THE, and ARWU. Dongguk faces the real risk of being **delisted**.

2.  **Class Action Lawsuit:**
    Students pay tuition for a "Global University." If that global infrastructure is fake, it is **Consumer Fraud**. Students have grounds for a class-action lawsuit for the return of tuition fees and damages for the devaluation of their degree.

3.  **IEQAS Decertification:**
    The Ministry of Education's IEQAS (International Education Quality Assurance System) certification relies on accurate data. Dongguk's failure to update its partner list for over 260 days—despite our reports—suggests they know that correcting it would cost them their certification.

## 260 Days of Silence

We reported the first falsified Canadian partnership to the Korean Ministry of Education on **April 10, 2025**.
It has been **over 260 days**.
*   The Ministry has done nothing.
*   Dongguk has updated nothing.

The silence is deafening. But the evidence is now undeniable.

**We demand an immediate investigation by the Ministry of Education and a full audit by all global ranking organizations.**
