First, it was Seoul National University (SNU). On January 26, the database housing their international partnership records mysteriously went dark. We noted it, archived the error pages, and waited.

Now, on February 11—closely following the blackout at SNU—two more major institutions, **Chung-Ang University** and **Sogang University**, have manually pulled the plug on their International Partner databases.

It’s almost as if they have something to hide.

## The "Global Excellence" Irony

On September 24, 2025, *The Korea Times* unveiled its "K-universities Global Excellence Rankings 2026", specifically designed to guide international students.

Ironically, the top performers in "Global Readiness" are the exact institutions now deleting their global records to evade audit.

*   **#2 Seoul National University (SNU):** Went Offline Jan 26.
*   **#6 Sogang University:** Went Offline Feb 11.
*   **#10 Dongguk University:** Panic Scrubbed (Sighted Jan 21).
*   **#11 Chung-Ang University:** Went Offline Feb 11.

## The Timeline of Obstruction

The timing of these outages removes any "routine maintenance" plausibility. This appears to be a coordinated response to increasing scrutiny.

*   **Jan 26, 2026:** SNU Partnership DB vanishes.
*   **Feb 11, 2026, 02:40 AM:** **Sogang University** OIA site goes offline.
*   **Feb 11, 2026, 09:45 AM:** **Chung-Ang University** OIA site goes offline.

## Evidence of "Semantic Fraud"

This is not a technical glitch. This is **spoliation of evidence**. These universities are attempting to hide the public records of their international partnerships—partnerships that we allege are legally void due to undisclosed "Semantic Fraud" regarding student safety and human rights protections.

We have logged the exact moment Chung-Ang University killed their network:
*   **Target:** `https://oia.cau.ac.kr/sub02/sub01.php`
*   **Status:** Offline / Connection Refused.

Forensic archives of the outage have been secured:
*   Megalodon Archive: [https://megalodon.jp/2026-0211-0956-48/https://oia.cau.ac.kr:443/sub02/sub01.php](https://megalodon.jp/2026-0211-0956-48/https://oia.cau.ac.kr:443/sub02/sub01.php)

Sogang University's offline status has also been forensically captured:

## The Trap: We Already Have the Data

Here is the irony of this frantic digital shredding: **They are burning the files after we already made copies.**

Between **January 1 and January 3, 2026**, we successfully archived the *entirety* of these 28 target universities' websites in forensic **WACZ (Web Archive Collection Zipped)** format.

Attempting to scrub the internet now only adds a charge of **Audit Obstruction** to the list of grievances.

*   **Jan 1-3 Baseline (`k-uni-partner-pages.wacz`):** Full website captures of the initial 28 targets.
*   **Feb 11 Gap Closure (`koreatimes-top30.wacz`):** Captures of the newly identified "Top 30" targets.
*   **Access the Archives:** [https://drive.proton.me/urls/F5PM468JNM#D3aT2Bghd7lb](https://drive.proton.me/urls/F5PM468JNM#D3aT2Bghd7lb)

## Expanding the Net: The Top 30 Gap Analysis

When The Korea Times published its "Global Excellence Rankings," it inadvertently provided us with a roadmap of who else to check. We cross-referenced their Top 30 list against our initial audit of 28 universities and found 13 schools we hadn't prioritized.

Thanks to this ranking, we have now closed that gap. **All 13 missing universities have been archived.**

The universities are panic-deleting their history. Unfortunately for them, public archives and our offline backups have a permanent memory.
