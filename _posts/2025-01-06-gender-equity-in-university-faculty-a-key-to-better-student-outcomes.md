In conversations about educational excellence, we often focus on rankings, research output, and curriculum. But there’s a quieter, more powerful indicator of institutional quality that deserves urgent attention: gender equity among faculty.

A growing body of international research shows that gender-balanced faculties don’t just promote fairness—they tangibly improve student outcomes. From boosting female retention in STEM to broadening perspectives for all students, having women represented at the front of the classroom changes how students learn, engage, and envision their futures.

A recent advocacy brief titled **“Gender Equity in University Faculty: A Key to Better Student Outcomes”** brings together compelling global and East Asian evidence, including from UNESCO, Harvard’s Gender Action Portal, and Korea’s own Ministry of Education. The findings are unequivocal: institutions with all-male faculties risk depriving students—especially women—of role models, mentorship, and inclusive pedagogy. Worse still, they normalize the idea that authority and expertise belong only to men.

In light of ongoing scrutiny toward universities like **Dongguk University in Korea**, where some graduate programs have zero female faculty and proximity to male-dominated industries like film, this paper is not just timely—it’s essential reading for anyone involved in higher education reform.
