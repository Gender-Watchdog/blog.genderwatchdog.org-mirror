**October 14, 2025**

A disturbing pattern has emerged in how Korean media handles racist incidents: Korean-language outlets may report violence against non-Koreans, but English-language press systematically ignores these same incidents—while providing immediate sympathetic coverage when Koreans claim discrimination abroad, even when no physical harm occurred.

**The result:** International audiences, English-speaking foreigners in Korea, and international students receive NO warning about documented patterns of violence, police dismissiveness, and racial profiling.

For clarity, in this post "English‑language press" refers primarily to Korea Herald and Hankyoreh. Korea JoongAng Daily is a notable English‑language exception that did cover the September 2025 hate‑crime conviction.

<h2 style="color:#000; margin-top:0;">🚨 UPDATE: October 17, 2025 — Political Party-Affiliated Hate Crime Goes Viral (51,000 Likes, Zero English Press Coverage)</h2>

<p style="color:#000;"><strong>Three days after publishing this investigation documenting how Korea Herald systematically erases anti-Chinese violence from English-language coverage, video of a new hate crime has gone viral in Korea with 51,000 likes.</strong></p>

<p style="color:#000;"><strong>English-language Korean press coverage as of October 18, 2025:</strong> None found in Korea Herald, Hankyoreh, or Korea Times.</p>

<h3 style="color:#000;">What the Video Documents</h3>

<p style="color:#000;"><strong>⚠️ CONTENT WARNING:</strong> This video contains explicit racist violence, racial slurs against Chinese people equivalent to the most offensive racist language in English, and physical aggression toward a business and its customers. Viewer discretion strongly advised.</p>

**What happened:** A Korean man wearing a **People Power Party (국민의힘) jacket**—South Korea's **main conservative opposition party**—enters a Chinese-owned PC room (internet cafe) in Seoul, kicks objects, and verbally assaults customers and staff with explicit racial slurs.

**Video documentation:**
- [View video on Twitter/X](https://x.com/malhee_2/status/1979122379822403686) (51,000 likes as of Oct 18)
- [Archived evidence](https://archive.md/wcvod)
- [Direct video link](https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1979122279314255872/vid/avc1/720x1170/hQtVOl3jNuXaiMe4.mp4?tag=21)

**Korean text overlays visible in video:**
1. "중국인 PC방 가서 세비 털기" — "Going to Chinese PC room to cause trouble/rob"
2. "야 이 씨발 중국 짱깨" — "Hey, you fucking Chinese [racial slur]"
3. "병신 새끼들아" — "You fucking idiots/bastards"

**"짱깨" (jjangkkae)** is a derogatory racial slur against Chinese people equivalent to the most offensive racist epithets in English.

### The Political Party Affiliation Significance

**This is not hidden political identity.** The perpetrator wears a jacket prominently displaying **"국민의힘" (People Power Party)**—the main conservative opposition party's official merchandise—while committing racist harassment against an ethnic minority business.

**What this signals:**
- Perpetrator feels sufficiently emboldened to display political party affiliation during hate crime
- No attempt to hide identity or political association
- Suggests perceived institutional protection or tolerance
- Hate crime operates with political signaling, not in secret

### Public Normalization: 51,000 Likes

The tweet documenting this incident received **51,000 likes** as of October 18, 2025.

**Tweet author's observation:** "이딴 딥스에 하트수 5.1만인게 대한민국 평균인 ㄷㄷ"  
**Translation:** "This kind of [content] has 51,000 likes, that's the average Korean"

**This is not condemnation—it's viral approval of racist violence.**

### Why This Confirms Our Investigation's Thesis

**Our October 14 investigation documented:**
- Korean courts confirming hate crimes (Sept 2025)
- Presidential intervention required (Sept-Oct 2025)
- Chinese embassy travel warnings
- Police racial profiling (documented by JTBC)
- Systematic English-language press silence

**Three days later, this new incident demonstrates:**

**Institutional tolerance escalating to political signaling:**
- May 2025: Chinese woman beaten in Hongdae
- Sept 2025: Taiwanese YouTuber beaten, police initially blame Chinese suspects
- Sept 2025: Courts confirm hate crimes with "longstanding hostility" language
- Sept-Oct 2025: Presidential intervention required
- **Oct 17, 2025: Perpetrator wears conservative opposition party (PPP) jacket during hate crime, receives 51k likes**

**Social normalization through viral approval:**
- Not underground violence—publicly documented with 51,000 likes
- Social media response is approval, not condemnation
- "That's the average Korean" observation from Korean Twitter user

**English-language press complicity continues:**
- We published investigation Oct 14 documenting systematic erasure
- New viral hate crime Oct 17 with political party affiliation
- Oct 18: Still zero English-language coverage

**The pattern is not breaking—it's accelerating with political institutional signaling.**

### What International Students Aren't Being Told

**If you are Chinese, Taiwanese, or perceived as Chinese in South Korea:**

- Hate crimes now occur with perpetrators displaying political party affiliation (conservative opposition party)
- Public social media response shows viral approval (51k likes), not condemnation
- Ethnic minority businesses in Chinese neighborhoods face systematic targeting
- Police patterns (documented in our investigation) show dismissiveness and racial profiling
- English-language press will not inform international audiences about this violence

**Your embassies have issued travel warnings. Korean courts have confirmed hate crimes with "longstanding hostility" language. The president had to intervene because violence became so severe. And now political party-affiliated racist violence is going viral with 51,000 likes while English-language Korean press maintains complete silence.**

### The Two-Tier Information System in Real Time

**This update demonstrates the exact pattern we documented on October 14:**

**Korean-language social media:** Video goes viral with 51,000 likes (high visibility)  
**English-language Korean press:** Complete silence (information erasure)

**Result:** International students planning to study in Korea have no access to this information unless they monitor Korean-language social media or read investigations like ours.

**Three days.** It took three days after publishing our investigation for another hate crime to go viral with political party affiliation visible—and for English-language press to repeat the exact same erasure pattern we documented.

**This is not accidental omission. This is systematic racial gatekeeping.**

## The Double Standard in Action

### Violence Against Non-Koreans in Korea: Minimized or Ignored

**Case 1: Chinese Woman Violently Attacked in Seoul (May 2025)**

On Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book, China's primary social media platform), a Chinese woman documented being violently attacked in Seoul's Hongdae area.¹ According to her account:

- A stranger tried to forcibly drag her and her friend into a pet shop
- When they refused, the attacker "went crazy" and beat them severely
- The attacker grabbed her by the hair
- They feared the attacker would use pet grooming tools (scissors, etc.) to harm them further
- Passers-by called police
- The women filed a police report

**Case 2: Taiwanese YouTuber Assaulted in Hongdae After Rejecting Advances (September 2025)**

A Taiwanese internet influencer and her friend were violently attacked by Korean men in Seoul's Hongdae area after refusing their sexual advances.² ³ ⁴ ⁵

**What happened:**
- Two Korean men approached the women around 3 AM (some reports say 5 PM)
- Men suggested "spending a night together" (하루밤 같이 보내자고) and touched them without consent
- When the women refused, the men beat them
- **Victim sustained extensive injuries:** Fractured thumb, severe bruising across arms, torso, abdomen, and legs
- Photographic evidence shows bruising covering multiple body parts
- Police arrived 5 minutes after being called

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/10132025-hate-crimes-coverage-korean-press/taiwnese-youtuber-injuries-closeup.jpg?raw=true" alt="Extensive bruising across arms, torso, abdomen, and legs of Taiwanese YouTuber after assault in Seoul Hongdae" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:4px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 0.9em;">Extensive injuries sustained by Taiwanese YouTuber: fractured thumb and severe bruising across arms, torso, abdomen, and legs (September 2025)</p>
</div>

**Police response:**
- Officers checked the victim's passport number and released the suspects without detention
- **Despite extensive injuries (fractured bone, bruising across multiple body parts), police told victims: "This happens all the time in Hongdae, stop crying and go home"**
- Released suspects immediately—no detention despite photographic evidence of severe beating
- **Police initially announced the suspects were Chinese men in their 20s**
- Victim disputed this, noting the attackers carried Korean IDs and spoke fluent Korean
- Police later issued a "correction," claiming they had "confused" this case with another assault involving a Chinese man and Taiwanese woman

**How is this confusion even possible?**
- Original case: Multiple Korean suspects, Taiwanese woman with friend, rejected sexual advances
- "Confused" case: One Chinese suspect, Taiwanese woman alone
- These are completely different incident profiles

**Media coverage:**
- **Korean-language outlets:** Hankook Ilbo, JTBC,⁵ and Hangguk Kyeongjae (한국경제TV)⁴ published articles
- **Korea Times:** AI-translated Hankook Ilbo's Korean article (sister publication) - minimal effort, no English-language reporter assigned³
- **Korea Herald:** Published NO coverage
- **Coverage angle:** Reports documented the assault but varied in how prominently they featured police incompetence and racial profiling
- **Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to intervene and demand action**

<div style="margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/10132025-hate-crimes-coverage-korean-press/hangguk-kyeongjae-taiwan-youtuber-assaulted.jpg?raw=true" alt="Hangguk Kyeongjae news coverage of Taiwanese YouTuber assault" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:4px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

</div>

**Chinese social media response:**
One Xiaohongshu user noted: "Initially the news said the attacker was Chinese. When the victim corrected them that it was a Korean [with Korean ID], the news issued a laughable correction saying police 'mixed up the cases.'"²

### The "Minimal Effort" Coverage Pattern

Korea Times did publish an English article about the Taiwanese YouTuber assault—but with telling limitations:³

**What Korea Times did:**
- AI-translated an article from Hankook Ilbo (their Korean sister publication)
- Used generative AI translation with minimal editing
- No original English-language reporting
- No English-language reporter assigned to the story

**Article disclaimer:** "This article from the Hankook Ilbo, the sister publication of The Korea Times, is translated by a generative AI and edited by The Korea Times."

**What this reveals:**
- Korea Times considered the story newsworthy enough to translate
- BUT not newsworthy enough to assign an English-language reporter
- Minimal resources allocated (AI translation, not human reporting)

**Compare to Korea Herald's McDonald's coverage:**
- Original English-language article⁷
- Sympathetic framing
- Full human-written reporting
- Published for international audience

**The pattern:** When Korean claims discrimination abroad → full original coverage. When non-Korean violently assaulted in Korea → AI translation of Korean article (if covered at all).

## Korean Courts Confirm Hate Crimes—But Victims' Stories Still Ignored

### September 2025: Court Explicitly Identifies "Hate Crime" Motive

While Korean-language outlets covered the Taiwanese YouTuber assault, there's an even more damning example of English-language press selectivity: a Korean court case that **explicitly confirmed hate crimes against Chinese-speaking foreigners.**

**Korea JoongAng Daily (September 3, 2025):**¹⁰

A Korean man was sentenced to **10 months in prison** for two separate racially motivated assaults:

**Incident 1: Attack on Chinese Women on Public Transport**
- Attacker assaulted two Chinese women for "speaking Chinese too loudly"
- Motivated by language/ethnicity

**Incident 2: Attack on Taiwanese Tourists at Restaurant**
- Attacker assaulted Taiwanese tourists at a Seoul restaurant
- He mistakenly believed them to be Chinese
- Attacked them specifically because he thought they were Chinese nationals

**Court ruling:** The judge cited **"longstanding hostility"** and confirmed **hate crime motives targeting Chinese nationals** as aggravating factors.

**English-language coverage:** Korea JoongAng Daily covered it. Korea Herald? No article found in their archives about this hate crime conviction.

**The pattern continues:** Korean courts are literally confirming hate crimes in legal rulings, and Korea Herald's English-language coverage remains selective.

## The Crisis Requiring Presidential Intervention

### President Lee Jae Myung Had to Intervene (September-October 2025)

The violence against Chinese-speaking foreigners became severe enough to require **presidential-level intervention.**¹¹ ¹²

**President Lee Jae Myung's statement:**
- Publicly called for an end to hate speech and acts of violence targeting foreign visitors
- Explicitly mentioned "recent surges in anti-China rallies and attacks"
- Government condemned hate speech in major Seoul shopping and tourist districts (Myeong-dong)
- Police promised crackdowns

**Chinese Embassy Response:**¹²
- Issued **official travel warnings** for Chinese citizens
- Advised avoiding certain areas in Seoul
- Cited "recent increase in violence and protests against Chinese nationals"

**Korea Herald coverage:**¹¹
- Published articles about government condemnation of anti-China protests
- Covered police promises of crackdowns
- Covered official statements

**What Korea Herald didn't cover:**
- Individual victims' experiences (like the Xiaohongshu posts)
- Specific assault incidents documented by victims
- Personal accounts from Chinese and Taiwanese victims
- The Taiwanese YouTuber assault with extensive injuries (fractured bone, severe bruising across arms, torso, abdomen, legs)

**The gatekeeping pattern:** Cover the sanitized official response, ignore the victims telling their stories.

### Meanwhile: Korean "Victim" of Alleged Discrimination Gets Immediate Press

**Case 3: Korean YouTuber Claims Discrimination at NY McDonald's (October 2025)**

A Korean YouTuber who has lived in the US for six years as a permanent resident claimed she experienced racial discrimination at a McDonald's in New York.⁷

**What happened:**
- She waited 40 minutes for her order at a not-busy McDonald's
- Other customers were served before her
- She asked five times when her order would be ready
- After waiting over an hour, she left without receiving food
- She claimed to overhear employees saying "They will probably never order from McDonald's again" while laughing

**Physical harm:** None. No assault. No threats.

**Evidence of racial motivation:** Inconclusive. Could be poor service, staff error, or discrimination—impossible to verify.

**Korean media response:**
- **Korea Herald published article with sympathetic framing**⁷
- Article notes the Instagram post "quickly went viral, garnering over 11.12 million views"
- Korean users flooded comments: "Let's report this to McDonald's headquarters"
- YouTuber threatened legal action

**The contrast:**
- Chinese woman beaten in Seoul pet shop attack: No Korea Herald coverage
- Taiwanese woman severely beaten (fractured bone, extensive bruising), police dismissive: Korea Herald silent
- Korean man sentenced for hate crimes against Chinese-speaking foreigners (September 2025): Korea JoongAng Daily covered it, Korea Herald ignored it
- Korean woman experiences slow service at McDonald's in New York: Korea Herald article, viral support, legal action threatened

---

## The Pattern of Official Complicity

### Police Initially Blame "Chinese" Suspects

The Taiwanese YouTuber case reveals something more sinister than incompetence: **initial police reporting blamed Chinese suspects before evidence was examined.**

Timeline:²
- **9:50 AM Wednesday:** Mapo Police Station announces "a Chinese man in his 20s assaulted two Taiwanese women"
- Victim disputes this: suspects had Korean IDs, spoke fluent Korean
- **4:40 PM same day:** Police issue "correction" - actually "mutual assault between Taiwanese woman and Korean man"
- Police excuse: They "confused" the case with another assault

**This "confusion" is implausible:**
- Different number of suspects (one vs. multiple)
- Different nationalities of suspects (Chinese vs. Korean)
- Different incident dynamics (what "mutual assault" when women were rejecting unwanted advances?)
- Both incidents occurred in same area within hours—how does this make confusion MORE likely?

**Alternative interpretation:** Police reflexively blamed Chinese suspects, had to backtrack when victim provided evidence.

---

## The Broader Context: Anti-Chinese Sentiment and Racial Profiling

### Public Opposition to Chinese Visitors

Xiaohongshu posts document street polls in Korea asking about visa-free travel for Chinese citizens.⁶ Visual evidence shows:

- Poll board originally in Korean (Hangul) asking about Chinese visa-free travel policy
- Korean terms: "찬성" (agree) and "반대" (oppose)
- Chinese translations overlaid by Xiaohongshu user's device: "赞成" (agree) and "反对" (oppose)
- Topic: "중국인 무비자 입국" (Korean) translated as "中国公民免签入境" (Chinese citizens visa-free entry)
- The "반대" (oppose) side covered with far more colored stickers than "찬성" (agree)

Korean public sentiment toward Chinese visitors is measurably hostile.

### Media-Fueled Stereotypes

When Korean Chinese suspects commit crimes, Korean media emphasizes their ethnicity—even when crime statistics don't support racial profiling.

**Korea Times investigation (May 2025):**⁸
- Three knife incidents involving Chinese nationals occurred in southern Gyeonggi Province
- Online reactions: "Deport all Chinese nationals," "Don't call Joseonjok our fellow Koreans"
- **Reality:** In 2023, Chinese nationals accounted for just **1.2% of all criminal suspects** (Koreans: 97.4%)
- 2022 CBS survey: 83.5% of Korean university students describe ethnic Korean Chinese (Joseonjok) as "rough" or "dangerous"
- 70.9% said movies and TV dramas shaped this image

**Expert assessment:**

> "Their Chinese identity has no connection to the crimes themselves. This should be treated as a criminal matter—not framed as a 'Joseonjok problem.' This kind of thinking plays a major role in driving our society toward racial prejudice." 
> 
> — Kim Hee-gyeo, professor of Northeast Asian Cultural Industries at Kwangwoon University⁸

## What Korean English-Language Media Covers vs. What It Ignores

### Korea Herald's Selective Coverage Strategy

**What Korea Herald WILL cover about anti-Chinese violence:**¹¹ ¹²
- Government officials condemning hate speech
- Police promises of crackdowns
- Official statements and policy announcements
- Presidential intervention

**What Korea Herald WON'T cover:**
- Individual assault victims' stories (Xiaohongshu posts)
- Taiwanese YouTuber with extensive injuries (fractured bone, severe bruising across body) and police dismissiveness
- Chinese woman beaten in Hongdae
- Court cases confirming hate crime motives (Korea JoongAng Daily covered it, Korea Herald didn't)
- Personal accounts of victims experiencing violence

**The observed pattern:** Report on official responses to the crisis, but omit the actual victim experiences for international audiences.

**Result:** English-speaking readers know Korean officials are "addressing hate speech" but have no idea what victims are experiencing or how severe the violence is.

### Korea Ranked 5th Worst Country for Racial Equity

According to US News & World Report, **South Korea ranked 5th worst among 89 countries surveyed** for racial equity.⁹

The report cited:
- Systemic issues like limited child care support for immigrant families
- Restrictive work permit policies
- Difficulty for migrants to gain permanent residency

### "Korean-Style Racism"

Professor Park Kyung-tae of Sungkonghoe University describes the distinctive characteristics:⁹

> "Korean-style racism internalizes Western racial hierarchies, where white people are at the top and Black people are at the bottom. Koreans see themselves as somewhere in the middle—ideally closer to the top—and take pride in that position."

**Result:** Nonwhite Asian immigrants face discrimination tied to their country's economic status.

### Why Koreans Dismiss Xenophobia as "Subtle"

Professor Park:⁹

> "We compare ourselves to countries where people are shot or stabbed because of racial hatred and say, 'It's not that bad here.' But we fail to see the daily discrimination and hatred that persist. We don't have a clear standard for what counts as serious (in our society)."

**Contrary to this perception, the violence IS happening:**
- Chinese women beaten in Seoul
- Taiwanese women beaten, fractured bones
- Police dismissive: "This happens all the time in Hongdae"

**Yet Korean media covers:** Korean woman waits too long at McDonald's.

---

## The Media's Racist Gatekeeping

### The English-Language Coverage Disparity:

**What Korea Herald Covers:**

✓ Korean YouTuber experiences slow service at NY McDonald's (no assault, inconclusive if racism)
- Korea Herald: Full sympathetic article⁷
- Public support: "Let's report to McDonald's headquarters"
- YouTuber threatens legal action
- Viral social media amplification (11+ million views)

**What Korea Herald Doesn't Cover:**

✗ Chinese woman violently beaten in Seoul, feared attacker would use scissors
- Korea Herald: No article found
- Hankyoreh: No article found

✗ Taiwanese YouTuber severely beaten (fractured bone, extensive bruising across arms, torso, abdomen, legs), police dismissive and initially blamed Chinese suspects
- Korea Herald: No article found
- Hankyoreh: No article found
- **Korean-language outlets** (JTBC,⁵ Hangguk Kyeongjae,⁴ Hankook Ilbo) DID cover it
- **Korea Times:** AI-translated Hankook Ilbo article (minimal effort, no English reporter)³
- **Korea Herald:** Completely ignored it

✗ Street polls showing Korean public opposition to Chinese visitors
- No English-language Korean press coverage found

### The Coverage Pattern:

1. **When Koreans claim victimhood abroad:** English-language press provides immediate sympathetic coverage—even for non-violent, inconclusive incidents

2. **When non-Koreans are victims of violence in Korea:** 
   - Korean-language outlets may cover basic facts
   - English-language outlets (Korea Herald, Hankyoreh) provide NO coverage
   - International intervention (Taiwan MOFA) required for case to be taken seriously

3. **When suspects might be non-Korean:** 
   - Police initially blame foreigners (Chinese), issue "corrections" later
   - JTBC documented this racial profiling

4. **When suspects are Korean attacking non-Koreans:** 
   - Police normalize it: "This happens all the time"
   - English-language press ignores it entirely

### The Resource Allocation Pattern

**For violence against non-Koreans in Korea:**
- Korea Herald: Zero coverage
- Korea Times: AI translation of sister publication article (no English reporter assigned)
- Resource allocation: Minimal

**For Korean claims of discrimination abroad:**
- Korea Herald: Full original article, sympathetic framing, human reporter
- Resource allocation: Standard/full

**What this reveals:** English-language Korean press considers international student safety worth less than half the resources (AI translation vs. human reporting) compared to Korean victimhood narratives abroad.

---

## Why This Matters

### Press Coverage Shapes Public Perception

Korean media's selective coverage creates a false narrative:
- Koreans are victims of discrimination abroad (amplified, sympathized)
- Non-Koreans in Korea who report violence are not credible or not newsworthy (minimized, ignored)

### Official Complicity Enables Violence

Police response to Taiwanese YouTuber assault:²
- "This happens all the time in Hongdae"
- Initially blamed Chinese suspects (false)
- Released suspects without detention despite fractured bone injury
- Required Taiwan MOFA intervention for case to be taken seriously

**Message sent:** Violence against non-Koreans is normalized, won't be seriously investigated, and will be blamed on other foreigners first.

### Statistical Reality vs. Media Narrative

**The data:**⁸
- Chinese nationals: 1.2% of criminal suspects (2023)
- Korean nationals: 97.4% of criminal suspects

**The coverage:**
- When Korean Chinese suspects commit crimes: Ethnicity emphasized, stereotypes reinforced
- When Korean suspects attack non-Koreans: Minimized as "this happens all the time," ethnicity downplayed

---

## The Contrast in Diplomatic Responses

### When Non-Koreans Are Attacked in Korea:

**Taiwanese YouTuber case:**
- Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to intervene²
- Taiwan MOFA demanded Korean authorities ensure safety of Taiwanese nationals
- Only THEN did Korean police reinvestigate

**Chinese woman beaten in Seoul:**
- Victim filed police report¹
- No apparent follow-up visible in public reporting
- No diplomatic intervention noted

### When Korean Claims Discrimination Abroad:

**McDonald's case:**
- Korean YouTuber threatens legal action⁷
- Viral social media support (11+ million views)
- Korea Herald coverage amplifies story
- Public campaigns: "Let's report to McDonald's headquarters"

**No Korean government intervention needed** — Korean press and public provide instant amplification.

---

## Methodology Scope & Limitations

- We searched Korea Herald and Hankyoreh web archives and social feeds on October 14, 2025 (KST). Search terms included: “Taiwanese YouTuber Hongdae,” “Hongdae assault Taiwanese,” “hate crime Chinese Seoul,” and Korean equivalents.
- Absence‑of‑coverage statements refer to those outlets as of October 14, 2025, 22:00 KST. We will update if coverage appears later or if outlets provide comment.

## Related Investigation: When Universities Enable Exploitation

This pattern of English-language erasure extends beyond street violence to institutional exploitation.

**In our recent investigation,** we documented how Dongguk University's WISE campus in Gyeongju is forcing international students to share "student housing" with tourists booked through commercial platforms—while the university's president operates under criminal prosecution.

**The same university has 2 out of 5 Canadian partnerships falsified on their official website** (UBC's official partnerships page doesn't list Dongguk despite Dongguk's claims, plus one anonymous Canadian university that explicitly denied any partnership agreement). UBC has been unresponsive to 5+ months of outreach. **English-language Korean press coverage of this international partnership fraud: essentially none.**

**Read: [APEC Leaders Will Meet in the Same City Where Students Are Forced to Share Dorms with Tourists](https://genderwatchdog.substack.com/p/apec-leaders-will-meet-in-the-same)**

Key findings:
- Chinese students report backpackers and tourist families in "student housing"
- Starting 2026: University making exploitative off-campus housing MANDATORY for all new students
- Students denied refunds, forced to pay extra fees when classmates flee
- Administrative offices "pretend to be deaf and blind" to complaints
- All happening in same city where APEC leaders will meet Oct 27-Nov 1 to discuss "AI governance"

**The connection:** Whether it's street violence or institutional exploitation, the pattern is identical—Korean-language audiences may hear about problems, English-language audiences are kept ignorant. International students and visitors are systematically denied safety information.

## A Call for Accountability

### For Korean Media:

**Questions that need answers:**

1. **Why did Korea Herald cover government condemnation of anti-China violence but not the September 2025 court case confirming hate crimes?**
   - Korea JoongAng Daily covered the hate crime conviction
   - Korea Herald covered official government responses
   - Korea Herald ignored the actual court case and victims' stories

2. **Why does Korea Herald cover a Korean YouTuber's inconclusive McDonald's service complaint in New York but not:**
   - A Taiwanese YouTuber's documented assault with extensive injuries (fractured bone, severe bruising across body) in Seoul?
   - Court-confirmed hate crimes against Chinese-speaking foreigners?
   - Chinese embassy travel warnings about violence in Seoul?

3. **Why does Korea Times minimize police dismissiveness** when covering violence against non-Koreans?
   - Police reportedly told victims "this happens all the time in Hongdae"
   - Police initially blamed Chinese suspects before investigation (documented by JTBC)
   - Taiwan MOFA had to intervene for case to be taken seriously

4. **Why is there no English-language Korean press coverage of:**
   - Documented anti-Chinese sentiment (street polls, multiple assault cases)?
   - Individual victims' experiences documented on Xiaohongshu?
   - Police racial profiling (which JTBC Korean-language coverage documented)?

5. **Why does English-language press cover "official responses" but not the crisis itself?**
   - Presidential intervention → Covered
   - Court-confirmed hate crimes → Ignored
   - Police crackdown promises → Covered
   - Assault victims' stories → Ignored
   - Chinese embassy warnings → Covered by Korea Times, not Korea Herald

6. **When Korean Chinese suspects commit crimes, why is ethnicity emphasized** while crime statistics show they offend at lower rates than Korean nationals (1.2% vs. 97.4%)?

### For Korean Police:

**The Mapo Police "confusion" excuse is not credible:**

- How do you confuse cases with different numbers of suspects?
- How do you confuse Korean suspects with Chinese suspects when victims provided Korean IDs as evidence?
- Why was the initial announcement that suspects were "Chinese men in their 20s" before investigation was complete?
- **Why were suspects released without detention despite victim's fractured bone and extensive bruising across multiple body parts?**
- Why tell victims with photographic evidence of severe beating to "stop crying and go home"?
- Why did it require Taiwan MOFA intervention for the case to be taken seriously?

### For International Students and Visitors:

**Safety warnings based on documented patterns:**

1. **Violence against non-Koreans may be normalized:** Police reportedly told assault victims "this happens all the time"
2. **Police may initially blame non-Korean suspects:** Taiwanese case shows reflexive misreporting
3. **Korean media may not cover attacks against you:** Chinese and Taiwanese assault victims received minimal/no English-language press coverage
4. **Diplomatic intervention may be necessary:** Taiwan MOFA had to intervene for assault case to be reinvestigated
5. **Document everything:** Victims in Xiaohongshu posts emphasized recording evidence, getting medical records, filing reports immediately

## Conclusion: English-Language Press as Racial Gatekeeping

The pattern reveals a systematic erasure of violence against non-Koreans in Korea:

### The Scale of What's Being Hidden:

**Legal confirmation:**
- Korean courts explicitly confirming hate crimes against Chinese-speaking foreigners (September 2025)¹⁰
- Judge cited "longstanding hostility" as aggravating factor
- 10-month prison sentence for targeting victims for speaking Chinese

**Presidential intervention:**
- President Lee Jae Myung had to publicly call for end to hate speech and violence¹¹
- Explicitly mentioned "recent surges in anti-China rallies and attacks"
- Government condemned hate speech in major Seoul tourist districts

**Diplomatic crisis:**
- Chinese embassy issued official travel warnings to avoid certain Seoul areas¹²
- Cited "recent increase in violence and protests against Chinese nationals"

**Documented victim experiences:**
- Chinese woman beaten in Seoul pet shop attack (Xiaohongshu documentation)¹
- Taiwanese YouTuber severely beaten with extensive injuries (fractured bone, severe bruising across arms, torso, abdomen, legs), police told them "this happens all the time"² ³ ⁴ ⁵
- Korean man sentenced for attacking Chinese women on public transport for "speaking Chinese too loudly"¹⁰
- Korean man sentenced for attacking Taiwanese tourists he mistook for Chinese¹⁰

### What Korea Herald Covered vs. Ignored:

**Korea Herald WILL cover:**
- Government condemnation of anti-China protests¹¹
- Police promises of crackdowns¹²
- Official policy statements
- Korean woman's inconclusive McDonald's service complaint in New York⁷

**Korea Herald WON'T cover:**
- Individual assault victims' stories
- Court cases confirming hate crimes (Korea JoongAng Daily covered it, Korea Herald didn't)
- Taiwanese YouTuber assault with extensive injuries (fractured bone, severe bruising across body)
- Chinese woman beaten in Hongdae
- Police racial profiling and dismissiveness

### The Two-Tier Information System:

1. **Korean-language press:** May cover violence (JTBC documented police racial profiling, Hangguk Kyeongjae covered Taiwanese assault)
2. **English-language press:** Systematically erases victim stories, covers only official sanitized responses
3. **Result:** International students arrive in Korea with no idea about:
   - Court-confirmed hate crimes
   - Presidential-level crisis requiring intervention
   - Chinese embassy travel warnings
   - Pattern of police dismissiveness ("this happens all the time")

**The message to international audiences:**
- Korean officials are "addressing hate speech" (vague, sanitized)
- Actual violence against non-Koreans? Hidden
- Police telling assault victims "this happens all the time"? Unreported
- If you don't read Korean, you're kept ignorant of safety risks

### This coverage pattern functions as racial gatekeeping disguised as editorial judgment.

When English-language press:
- Covers official condemnation of violence but not the violence itself
- Reports on government responses but not victim experiences
- Publishes full articles on Korean McDonald's service complaints abroad
- Ignores court-confirmed hate crimes against non-Koreans in Korea

...the media becomes complicit in:

1. **Normalizing racist violence** by making it invisible to international audiences
2. **Denying safety information** to international students and visitors
3. **Shielding police racial profiling** from international scrutiny
4. **Creating asymmetric narratives:** Koreans portrayed as racism victims globally, violence against non-Koreans in Korea erased
5. **Protecting Korea's international image** at the expense of victim safety

**The severity of the crisis:**
- Severe enough for presidential intervention ✓
- Severe enough for diplomatic warnings ✓
- Severe enough for court-confirmed hate crimes ✓
- Severe enough for Korea Herald to tell international audiences? ✗

The Chinese and Taiwanese victims who documented their experiences on Xiaohongshu are providing the safety warnings that Korea Herald refuses to publish—even when Korean courts and the president confirm the crisis is real.

**For International Students and Visitors:**

**The reality English-language press won't tell you:**
- Korean courts have confirmed hate crimes against Chinese-speaking foreigners¹⁰
- President had to intervene because violence became so severe¹¹
- Chinese embassy issued travel warnings for certain Seoul areas¹²
- Police reportedly tell assault victims "this happens all the time"² ³ ⁴ ⁵
- Police have initially blamed Chinese suspects before investigation (racial profiling documented by JTBC)⁵

**If you experience racist violence in Korea:**
1. **Document everything:** Photos, videos, medical records, witness information
2. **File police report immediately** and request copy
3. **Contact your country's embassy/consulate** - Taiwan MOFA had to intervene for the Taiwanese YouTuber case
4. **Document police response:** Are they dismissive? Do they minimize it? Do they initially blame the wrong nationality?
5. **Consider documenting on social media in your language** - Korean English-language press may not cover it, but Chinese/Taiwanese/other language communities need to know
6. **Connect with advocacy organizations** working on foreigner rights in Korea
7. **Check your embassy's travel advisories** - Chinese embassy has warned citizens about certain areas

**Your safety matters—even if Korea Herald won't tell you about the crisis Korean courts, the president, and diplomatic missions have all confirmed is real.**
