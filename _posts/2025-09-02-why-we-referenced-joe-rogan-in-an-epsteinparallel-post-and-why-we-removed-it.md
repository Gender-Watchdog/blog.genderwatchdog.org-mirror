Methodology note: Our advocacy uses “observed / consistent with / inference” framing based on timestamps, exit‑node patterns, and screen recordings. We correct quickly when clearer phrasing reduces ambiguity or risk of misinterpretation.

## Context

After documenting an observed surveillance pattern around our posts on Korean higher‑education exploitation, we experienced significant visibility suppression on X. We contacted @Support with evidence ([support tweet](https://x.com/Gender_Watchdog/status/1948948251165819301)); shortly after, post visibility appeared restored. In that same window, one post referenced Joe Rogan while drawing parallels between the U.S. Epstein scandal and international student exploitation dynamics in Korea. We have since removed the direct @ mention.

## Why the Epstein parallel matters

- Elite‑protection dynamics and intimidation can delay accountability in trafficking/sexual‑exploitation contexts.
- Vulnerable populations are targeted: in the U.S. case, minors; in Korea, foreign students (particularly women) in arts/culture programs with structural power imbalances (visas, grades, equipment, internships). Dongguk Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents is one risk example within broader sector issues we document.
- Parallels concern patterns (gatekeeping, retaliation, legal silencing), not equivalence of facts or actors.

## Why we referenced Joe Rogan

- Audience reach and discourse bridge: his audience frequently engages with institutional accountability and Epstein discussions.
- The mention was intended to connect audiences to documented evidence, not to endorse any individual.

## Why we removed the @ mention

- De‑amplification of personalities: to keep focus on evidence and survivor protection rather than celebrity discourse.
- Reduce misinterpretation/brigading risk: avoid personality‑driven polarization that can obscure documented facts.
- Editorial consistency: we’re standardizing on methodology‑forward language (observed/consistent with/inference) and avoiding unnecessary @ mentions.

## What remains

- We retained a transparent note acknowledging the earlier @ mention and its removal, and clarified our methodology.
- All core evidence, citations, and requests to stakeholders remain unchanged.

## Our standard for corrections

- If wording can be made more precise, we update and clearly label it.
- We keep provenance (correction replies, pinned canonical links) so journalists and diplomats can follow the record.

## Where to find the canonical materials

- Surveillance timing analysis (observed): see our main post for methodology and updates.
- APEC briefing (currently in‑country): diplomatic actions and student‑safety steps.
- Documentation hub and sources are linked throughout our recent posts.
