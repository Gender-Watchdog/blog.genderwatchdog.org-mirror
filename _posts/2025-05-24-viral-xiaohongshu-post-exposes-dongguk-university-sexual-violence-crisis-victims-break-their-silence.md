## Victim Testimonies Emerge

The viral post has created a safe space for victims to share their experiences, revealing a pattern of institutional failure and victim silencing at Dongguk University.

### Theatre Department Self-Censorship: Evidence of Fear and Retaliation

User **[Theatre Student - Name Redacted]** from the theatre studies department initially posted a revealing comment but then edited it, demonstrating the climate of fear surrounding criticism of Dongguk University:

**Original Comment:**
> "波澜背后的痛小透明的哭泣孤独，而且我们大谈特谈feminism。"

*Translation: "Behind all the drama are the silent tears and loneliness of nobodies, while we talk endlessly about feminism."*

![Original comment from theatre student about pain and loneliness behind feminist discussions](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-solidarity-feminism-redacted.png?raw=true)

**Edited Comment:**
> "戏剧学暂时没有认识的男教授，而且我们大谈特谈 Fimines"

*Translation: "Theatre studies currently has no male professors that I know of, and we talk extensively about feminism [or feminist issues]."*

![Edited comment after self-censorship, removing references to pain and suffering](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-no-male-profs-edit-redacted.png?raw=true)

This dramatic self-censorship reveals several critical issues:

1. **Fear of Retaliation**: The commenter removed all references to "pain," "tears," and "loneliness," suggesting fear of being identified and facing consequences for speaking honestly about conditions at the university.

2. **Institutional Intimidation**: The fact that students feel compelled to edit their comments to remove negative experiences demonstrates an atmosphere where criticism is dangerous.

3. **Hidden Suffering**: The original comment reveals that despite feminist discussions in the theatre department, students are experiencing significant emotional distress ("silent tears and loneliness of nobodies").

4. **Performative vs. Real Change**: The juxtaposition of talking "endlessly about feminism" while students suffer in silence suggests that discussions may not translate to actual protection or support for victims.

This self-censorship pattern is common in university environments where speaking out carries risks, and provides crucial evidence of the intimidating atmosphere that silences victims of sexual violence at Dongguk University.

### Personal Interview Misconduct

User **[Graduate Applicant - Name Redacted]** shared her direct experience with Dongguk University faculty:

> "em...我以前读研的时候 面试我的是个东大的教授. 两名里面其中一名 问的问题 就不是面试问题. 有关我个人隐私的 第一直觉告诉我 得跑 录取上后我直接退学了"

*Translation: "When I was applying for graduate school, I was interviewed by a Dongguk professor. One of the two interviewers asked questions that weren't interview questions - they were about my personal privacy. My first instinct told me to run. After being accepted, I directly withdrew."*

![[Graduate Applicant - Name Redacted]'s testimony about inappropriate interview questions from Dongguk professor](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-LucyM-inappropriate-questions-dongguk-interview-redacted.png?raw=true)

This testimony reveals how sexual misconduct begins at the admissions level, with faculty using their power to ask inappropriate personal questions of prospective female students.

### Ongoing Sexual Violence Against International Students

**[电影系学生 - 姓名已编辑]** ([Film Department Student - Name Redacted]) reported recent incidents:

> "上个学期还有个影像大留学生被前辈性骚扰了"

*Translation: "Last semester, a foreign student in the film program was sexually harassed by a senior student."*

![Report of recent sexual harassment of international film student by senior](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-senior-harass-foreign-student-imaging-redacted.png?raw=true)

This comment confirms that sexual violence continues to occur against international students in Dongguk's film programs, despite ongoing investigations.

### Faculty Discrimination and Institutional Racism

**[国际学生 - 姓名已编辑]** ([International Student - Name Redacted]) reported experiencing discrimination:

> "被东国大老师歧视过🙋"

*Translation: "I was discriminated against by a Dongguk teacher."*

![Student testimony about experiencing discrimination from Dongguk faculty](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-small-white-experienced-discrimination-redacted.png?raw=true)

This indicates a broader pattern of discriminatory behavior by faculty, potentially targeting international students based on nationality or race.

### Culture of Silence and Denial

The comments reveal a concerning culture where male students may be unaware of the sexual violence risks faced by their female peers. **王富贵** noted:

> "不是吧，我朋友圈里还有个这个学院的男研究生，天天发朋友圈说学校多好多好"

*Translation: "Really? I have a male graduate student from this school in my friend circle who posts daily about how great the school is."*

This highlights how sexual violence often remains invisible to those not directly affected, allowing institutions to maintain positive reputations while victims suffer in silence.

## Title IX Compliance Crisis

The viral post detailed Dongguk University's structural sexual violence risks that expose US partner universities to Title IX liability:

- ❌ No independent, safe sexual violence reporting system
- ❌ Zero full-time female professors in graduate film program  
- ❌ Women's student council abolished during Korea's MeToo movement peak (2018)
- ❌ Shared campus space with film company Sidus FNH
- ❌ Documented institutional negligence: 6-month delay after receiving sexual violence report in 2016

## Statistical Evidence of Crisis

The Korean Women's Development Institute's 2020 report confirms **61.5% of female arts students experience sexual violence**, with film programs scoring **81/100 on sexual violence risk assessment**. Dongguk University's unique arrangement sharing campus space with major film company Sidus FNH potentially elevates these risks further.

## Law Enforcement Notification

As documented in the viral post, Korean police and prosecutors were formally notified on May 21, 2025, regarding:

- Falsified international partnerships
- Alleged misuse of public funds
- Sexual violence cover-ups at the Graduate School of Digital Image and Content (Film School)

## International Response

The post details how Canadian universities have officially denied partnerships with Dongguk University, and US universities are re-evaluating collaborations due to Title IX compliance concerns. Global university ranking organizations have escalated the matter to management for review.

## Call for Justice

Our advocacy seeks justice for all victims of sexual violence at Dongguk University, regardless of the nationality, gender, or status of perpetrators and victims. The viral response demonstrates that when victims are given a platform to speak, they will break their silence.

The testimonies emerging from this viral post will be included in additional notifications to Korean prosecutors, as they provide crucial evidence of ongoing sexual violence and institutional negligence at Dongguk University.

We encourage any additional victims or witnesses to continue sharing their experiences safely, as every voice strengthens the case for systemic reform and accountability.

## Second Viral Post: Official International Responses Documented

A second viral post titled "东国大学性暴力危机｜美校警告" (Dongguk University Sexual Violence Crisis | US University Warning) published at [this URL](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/683120ed0000000023011821?xsec_token=ABUSUD2yTP5yARfFIrr7EEYxbiioZUCzJMsPOJllsgCpQ=&xsec_source=pc_user) has generated **1,561 views, 3 likes and 92 favorites with 26 comments**, documenting official responses from international institutions regarding Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis.

### Evidence of Campus Surveillance and Privacy Violations

A particularly disturbing comment from user **[Campus Resident - Name Redacted]** reveals potential surveillance violations in campus facilities:

> "什么瓜 还有我之前在经营馆女洗手间看到过小孔"

*Translation: "What's this about? Also, I previously saw small holes in the women's bathroom at the business building."*

This testimony suggests potential illegal surveillance of female students in bathroom facilities, representing a severe violation of privacy and potentially criminal activity. Such surveillance would constitute additional sexual violence through voyeurism and create an atmosphere of intimidation for female students.

### Prosecutor Notification Update

These documented official responses and evidence of potential surveillance crimes strengthen the case being presented to Korean prosecutors. The international dimension demonstrates how Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis extends beyond Korean borders and affects global academic integrity.

The combination of falsified partnerships, Title IX compliance failures, and potential criminal surveillance activities presents a comprehensive pattern of institutional corruption that demands immediate investigation and accountability.

Additional victims and witnesses continue to be encouraged to come forward safely, as the international attention ensures their voices will be heard and documented for legal proceedings.

### Strategic Pressure Matrix

This distribution creates a multi-directional accountability framework that exponentially amplifies pressure on Dongguk University and Korean authorities:

```

         │                        │
[Int'l Advocacy]        [Global Unis]

         \          |         /   │
          \         |        /    │
            ▼      ▼      ▼      ▼
           ┌─────────────────────┐
           │ Dongguk University  │
           └─────────────────────┘

                    ▼
 [Perpetrators of Sexual Violence]
  (Students, Faculty, Admin, Enablers)
```

### Magnified Pressure Effects

**Diplomatic Consequences:** Foreign embassies receiving evidence of sexual violence risks affecting their nationals creates immediate diplomatic pressure on Korean authorities to investigate and respond.

**International Academic Isolation:** Global universities and education organizations being informed simultaneously prevents Dongguk from controlling the narrative or limiting damage to specific regions.

**Media Amplification:** Coordinated distribution to Korean and international media ensures the story cannot be suppressed domestically while maintaining international visibility.

**Legal Accountability:** US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights receiving evidence creates potential Title IX enforcement actions against US universities partnering with Dongguk.

**Advocacy Network Activation:** International sexual violence prevention organizations being informed mobilizes global advocacy resources and expertise.

**Government Agency Coordination:** Multiple Korean ministries and agencies receiving identical evidence prevents bureaucratic deflection and creates internal pressure for coordinated response.

### Immediate Impact

This strategic distribution transforms isolated viral social media posts into a coordinated international incident requiring immediate institutional response. The 43-day government silence documented in the viral posts becomes increasingly untenable as diplomatic, academic, and advocacy pressure mounts from multiple directions simultaneously.

The comprehensive stakeholder engagement ensures that Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis and falsified partnerships cannot be contained as a domestic Korean issue, but must be addressed as an international academic integrity and student safety crisis affecting multiple nations and institutions.

This pressure matrix demonstrates how viral social media evidence, when strategically distributed to appropriate stakeholders, can create accountability mechanisms that transcend institutional and national boundaries to demand justice for sexual violence victims.
