This post documents a KakaoTalk open-chat exchange circulating on DC Inside (Dongguk Gallery → link post into the Film School minor gallery). It shows sexual violence in a digital context—explicit sexual insults and doxxing threats—within a university‑adjacent community. All offensive language is retained for evidentiary integrity.

Reference (as shown in screenshot):
- DC Inside Film School minor gallery link: [https://m.dcinside.com/board/artoffilmschool/1518](https://m.dcinside.com/board/artoffilmschool/1518)
 - DC Inside Dongguk Gallery intro post (links out to the Film School minor): see `screenshots/dc-inside-dongguk-intro-post.png` — title on the index reads roughly “동국대생의 성희롱 정당화” ("Justification for sexual harassment by a Dongguk student"), which itself frames the incident in a way that normalizes/argues over “justification,” signaling a problematic community posture.

KWDI’s 2020 study identified a 61.5% sexual violence rate among women in arts/culture faculties. This transcript provides a concrete example of the hostile online climate surrounding arts education communities.

> Content warning: contains explicit sexual language and threats of identification/doxxing.

## Line-by-Line Transcript (Korean → English)

Participants:
- [Yellow] = the user in yellow speech bubbles
- [Ryan] = nickname “베개를 부비적대는 라이언”

Times are as displayed in the UI (오후 = PM).

### Screenshot 1 (5:25–5:26 PM)
- [Yellow | 5:25] 니가 뭘 말할까 궁금해서  
  → I was curious what you would say.
- [Ryan | 5:26] 그래  
  → Okay.
- [Ryan | 5:26] 대화해보니 어떠니  
  → How is it, talking now?
- [Yellow | 5:26] 병ㅅ같음  
  → You’re acting pathetic. (ableist slur in Korean)
- [Ryan | 5:26] 나는 네가 그냥 사이비에 빠진 신도같다  
  → You seem like a follower who fell into a cult.
- [Ryan | 5:26] 너는 욕하면서 왜 나보고는 욕하지말라해  
  → You swear, but you tell me not to swear at you?
- [Yellow | 5:26] 넌 저급하니까  
  → Because you’re vulgar.
- [Yellow | 5:26] 똑같이 대해도 됨  
  → I can respond in kind.
- [Ryan | 5:26] 애미창녀**구녕에서 / 보지구녕에서 / 구렁내날것같은년아  
  → “You [expletive], born from your prostitute mother’s *** hole / from a p***y hole / like a snake would crawl out.” (extremely obscene, misogynistic insult)

### Screenshot 2 (5:28–5:29 PM)
- [Ryan | 5:28] 나도 중대 수소문해서 / 너 이지랄하는거 / 연출 제작 미술 파트 / 얘기할거니까  
  → I’ll ask around at Chung-Ang (University) and talk to the directing/production/art people about the way you’re acting. (implies doxxing/identification)
- [Ryan | 5:29] ㅋㅋ  
  → lol.
- [Yellow | 5:29] 통매음이랑 내가 너 병ㅅ이랑 한 거랑 죄가 같냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 사태파악 안 되나보네  
  → Do you think mass-defamation and what I did with you—an idiot—are the same offense? lol. You don’t seem to grasp the situation.
- [Ryan | 5:29] 고딩 쓰는 현장 특정 안될거라 생각하는거노  
  → You think what you wrote won’t let me identify your site/context?
- [Ryan | 5:29] 니가 먼저 시비를 걸었잖음  
  → You picked a fight first.
- [Ryan | 5:29] 저급하다느니  
  → Saying I’m low-class, etc.
- [Yellow | 5:29] 말 많네 난 기회도 줬고  
  → You talk a lot; I even gave you a chance.
- [Yellow | 5:29] 니가 찬거야  
  → You blew it.

### Poster’s note (visible below the chat in the capture) — paraphrased
- They went into the open chat for a one-on-one talk. The aggressor repeatedly asked sexualized questions, referenced “19,” and made sexual remarks. When asked to apologize, the aggressor refused and instead said they would “ask around” in film/production circles (incl. Chung-Ang University) to identify the target and “check the scene.” The note describes specific sexual violence in a digital context (sexualized abuse), implied threats, and no remorse.

### Screenshot 3 (DC Inside index capture)
- Dongguk Gallery listing shows the linked Film School minor post with a title implying “justification for sexual harassment.” See Figure 1.

### Screenshot 4 (DC Inside comment thread under the Film School post)
- See Figure 4.
- Comments directly below the linked post reflect mixed but revealing reactions. Without quoting users verbatim, observable themes include:
  - Warnings about a specific user being associated with sexual harassment rhetoric (cautionary tone).
  - Dismissive/bantering replies that minimize the severity, or pivot to unrelated celebrity/entertainment chatter.
  - Meta‑comments about whether the issue “belongs” in the gallery and light engagement signals (upvotes/views) inconsistent with the seriousness of described conduct.
- These reactions, taken with the screenshots, show a community environment that often trivializes or sidelines sexual‑violence reports even when doxxing threats are visible in the evidence.

## Analysis: What This Shows

- **Sexual violence (digital context):** The aggressor uses explicit sexual insults targeting the other participant. This is sexual violence, not “banter.”
- **Doxxing/identification threats:** References to “수소문해서… 현장 특정” (asking around to pinpoint who/where) escalate risk from online to offline harm.
- **Minimization and reversal:** The aggressor reframes the exchange as mutual and blames the target for “starting it,” which mirrors patterns we see when survivors report sexual violence.
- **Relevance to arts/film faculties:** The post circulates through Dongguk Gallery and a film-school minor gallery, aligning with documented high‑risk environments for arts programs identified by KWDI (61.5% of women in arts/culture faculties experienced sexual violence).
 - **Comment‑thread signals:** The comment thread captured in Figure 4 shows a split between cautionary notes and minimization/deflection. This supports our broader finding that online bystander communities frequently normalize or divert from sexual‑violence content, undermining accountability.

This conversation is consistent with a broader harassment ecosystem tied to Korean university arts circles, where online abuse and offline intimidation intersect.

## Why It Matters for International & Vietnamese/Japanese Students

- **International students** (and especially women) face additional vulnerabilities: language barriers, visa status, dependence on faculty/industry gatekeepers.
- **Racialized sexual violence**: Foreign women are targeted within hierarchies where reporting can trigger retaliation or legal exposure under Korea’s defamation/insult regime, which is frequently weaponized to criminalize truthful testimony (truth is not an absolute defense; “public interest” is narrowly construed). Entertainment companies operating around campuses have used legal threats to chill reporting—for example, Sidus’s threat at Dongguk; see: [Sidus Legal Threat Backfires](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/sidus-legal-threat-backfires-evidence-of-corporate-panic-and-institutional-cover-up-at-dongguk-university/).
- **Hostile climate** undermines safety claims made in recruitment materials and certification frameworks.

## Policy and Platform Demands

1) **Kakao Open Chat**: Enforce sexual violence/harassment rules; remove abusers; prevent repeat participation; support evidence retention for victims.  
2) **Universities (Dongguk + film schools)**: Treat online sexual violence and doxxing tied to academic/industry networks as conduct subject to sanctions; publish independent reporting channels; protect complainants from retaliation.  
3) **Certification bodies (IEQAS)**: Include online sexual violence metrics and enforcement in audits for high‑risk faculties (arts/film); require transparent annual reporting.  
4) **Legal reform discussion**: Prevent weaponization of defamation/insult laws against victims and advocates documenting sexual violence.

## Safety Guidance (Quick)
- Preserve evidence (original files + hashes, screenshots with timestamps).  
- Avoid direct escalation; log threats of identification/doxxing.  
- Report to platform and, where safe, to university channels; seek NGO/legal support.  
- If at risk, adjust account privacy, and coordinate with trusted peers for documentation.
