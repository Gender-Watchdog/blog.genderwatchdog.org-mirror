**September 2, 2025 (evening, ET)**

Methodology note: Based on timestamps, VPN exit‑node patterns, and screen recordings. Where direct attribution is not technically provable, we use “observed,” “consistent with,” and “inference.”

Following our earlier post documenting the cessation of an observed surveillance pattern, we observed intermittent monitoring within hours of publication. Subsequent checks did not always show access; therefore we are treating this as **sporadic activity** pending further data.

## What changed

- Our thread announcing cessation was followed by renewed access consistent with previously observed VPN exit nodes (screen recording + screenshots on file)
- Subsequent posts did not always trigger access; frequency currently appears **intermittent**

## Evidence availability

- Screen recording and screenshots are linked in post 8 of the update thread
- Copies available to credentialed press/journalists, parliamentary/oversight bodies, and partner organizations upon request at our discretion

## Why this matters

- Indicates continued capability to monitor in real time
- Pattern to date is consistent with **low‑coordination, rules‑based or manual checks** rather than centralized, continuous command (hypothesis; not asserted as fact)
- Reinforces the need for ongoing documentation before asserting a sustained resumption

We will continue to preserve evidence and issue a consolidated addendum to the earlier article once we confirm whether the intermittent hits consolidate into a sustained pattern.
