## Global Eyes on Korea: The Scandal No One Can Ignore

In the wake of Dongguk University's sexual violence coverup, partnership fraud, and the explosive legal threats from Sidus, Korea now finds itself under unprecedented international scrutiny. Our advocacy campaign has reached prosecutors, police, government agencies, major media, embassies, human rights organizations, and global education groups. The world is watching—and waiting to see how Korea responds.

## A Nation at a Crossroads: Presidential Election After Impeachment

This crisis comes at a historic moment. With the presidential election just days away, and following the impeachment of President Yoon for declaring martial law, Korea's democracy is being tested. The new administration will inherit not just a political transition, but a demand for real accountability and reform in higher education, women's safety, and government transparency.

## Media and Political Parties: Under Pressure to Act

Despite the overwhelming evidence, much of the Korean media has been timid—held back by legal risks, institutional pressure, and uncertainty. But with international media, embassies, and advocacy groups now in possession of the full story, silence is no longer an option. Political parties, too, are under pressure: whoever wins the election will be judged by how they address this scandal. Candidates who ignore or downplay the issue risk being seen as complicit in coverups and institutional abuse.

## Risks and Opportunities for Candidates

For political leaders, this is both a risk and an opportunity. Those who take a stand for transparency, victim protection, and systemic reform can win the trust of young voters, women, and the international community. Those who attempt to shield powerful institutions or sweep the issue under the rug will face backlash—not just at the polls, but in the court of global opinion.

## What's at Stake: Democracy, Education, and Women's Safety

This is about more than one university or one company. The Dongguk/Sidus/IEQAS scandal exposes deep flaws in Korea's higher education system, government oversight, and the treatment of sexual violence survivors. It raises urgent questions:
- Can Korea's democracy deliver justice and reform when the world is watching?
- Will international students and partners continue to trust Korean universities?
- Will women and vulnerable students be protected, or silenced?

## Call to Action

To voters: Demand answers from your candidates. Insist on real reform, not just apologies.

To students and faculty: Keep speaking out. Your voices are being heard around the world.

To international observers: Watch closely, and hold Korea to the same standards of transparency and justice expected of any global leader.

**This election is not just about politics—it's about the future of Korean democracy, education, and human rights. The world is watching.**
