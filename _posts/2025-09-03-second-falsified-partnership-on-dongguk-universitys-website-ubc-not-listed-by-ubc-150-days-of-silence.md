**September 3, 2025**

### Executive summary

- UBC's official "Current partnerships" page does not list Dongguk University under South Korea.
- Dongguk University's official partner list continues to list UBC (and at least one other Canadian university that requested anonymity).
- **UPDATED:** We first contacted Canadian universities about these partnership discrepancies on April 5-6, 2025, then notified seven Korean government agencies on April 10, 2025. As of today, that is **150+ days of silence** from institutions across two countries.
- We notified the Canadian Embassy in Seoul on April 27, 2025 and Global Affairs Canada; no public advisory has been issued.
 - We notified the Canadian Embassy in Seoul on April 27, 2025 and Global Affairs Canada; no public advisory has been issued. This follows a broader pattern of Canadian diplomatic non‚Äëaction on sexual exploitation abroad documented by investigative reporting (archived) (see: ‚Äúhow Canada let a child sex abuser run rampant across Asia‚Äù).
- This is now the second apparent falsified Canadian partnership on Dongguk's site, demonstrating that IEQAS certification fails as a safety/quality signal.
- Unless we receive responses within ~72 hours, we will notify all listed Dongguk partners and update ATIXA with a formal brief.

### What we verified (with archives)

- UBC "Current partnerships" (South Korea section) ‚Äî Dongguk University is not listed:
  - [Live page](https://global.ubc.ca/partner-ubc/current-partnerships)
  - [Web archive (timestamped)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250902055312/https://global.ubc.ca/partner-ubc/current-partnerships)
  - [Archive.today mirror](https://archive.md/jdNOp)

- Dongguk University "Partners" page ‚Äî UBC listed among partners:
  - [Live page](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554)
  - [Earlier archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250408154026/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554)

- Screenshot evidence (UBC page excerpt): ![UBC South Korea partnerships - Dongguk not listed](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/09032025-dongguk-false-partner-ubc/ubc-international-partners-sk.png?raw=true) *(South Korea section shows several institutions, but not Dongguk)*

We also maintain a public timeline page for Dongguk and government silence counters on our project domain. As of today, it displays **150+ days without response** since our first Canadian university outreach on April 5-6, 2025, and Korean government notifications on April 10, 2025.

### Why this matters beyond one university

Falsified partner claims are not a harmless clerical error. They:
- Mislead students and families into believing support structures exist abroad
- Inflate institutional legitimacy used to recruit and secure funding
- Distort due‚Äëdiligence by foreign universities and ranking/validation bodies

This is the second Canadian case we have documented. Repetition indicates a pattern ‚Äî not an isolated oversight. It also undercuts any confidence in Korea‚Äôs IEQAS certification regime as a real-world safety/quality signal.

---

### IEQAS is compromised by observable reality

We have previously detailed (May 12, 2025) why IEQAS cannot be relied upon, using Dongguk as a case study: a film/arts context with high sexual‚Äëviolence risk, partnership misrepresentation, and sustained institutional silence ‚Äî yet certification intact. See our longer analysis and sources:

Two demonstrably false Canadian partnerships on a single IEQAS‚Äëcertified university site make the certification‚Äôs practical value indefensible without external audit.

### Ethical dimension: claimed Buddhist affiliation vs. deceptive representations

Dongguk publicly claims a Buddhist affiliation. Persisting, for 150+ days, in listing partner institutions that do not confirm the relationship contradicts basic ethical precepts of truthfulness and non‚Äëharm. If these listings influence international students' decisions, then the deception has concrete safety implications.

This represents what we have documented as a [Triple Betrayal of Buddhist University](https://genderwatchdog.org#triple-betrayal-of-buddhist-university) principles, violating Right Speech, Right Livelihood, and the fundamental commitment to Truth. See our comprehensive analysis in [Preventing Sexual Violence and Buddhist Ethics: Open Letter to the Faculty of Buddhism at Dongguk University](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/sexual-violence-and-buddhist-ethics-open-letter-to-the-faculty-of-buddhism-at-dongguk-university/) and [Buddhist University Turns Blind Eye to Sexual Violence Risk](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/press-release-buddhist-university-turns-blind-eye-to-sexual-violence-risk/).

### What we've done and when

- **Apr 5-6, 2025** ‚Äî First contacted Canadian universities listed on Dongguk's partner page ‚Äî University of British Columbia, University of Manitoba, Toronto Metropolitan University, Mount Allison University, and Centennial College ‚Äî about partnership discrepancies and Title IX risks.
- **Apr 10, 2025** ‚Äî Notified seven Korean government agencies of documented partner misrepresentation and safety risks.
- **Apr 27, 2025** ‚Äî Notified the Canadian Embassy in Seoul (email), and contacted Global Affairs Canada; still no public advisory.
- **Aug 27, 2025 08:00** (local) ‚Äî Follow-up emails to UBC international partnerships and Go Global (admin inboxes) with evidence and right of reply.
- **Aug 30, 2025 08:00** (local) ‚Äî Follow‚Äëup to student associations (AMS UBC, CSSA UBC, TMU/TMSU, Centennial CSAI/ISO, MASU, UMSU) with evidence and asks.
- **Sep 2, 2025** ‚Äî **150+ days of silence** from Canadian universities and Korean agencies across two countries. We will allow ~72 hours from today for final replies before notifying all listed Dongguk partners and filing an update with ATIXA.

**Complete Email Documentation:** All outreach emails from April 5, 2025 through September 2, 2025 are available in our GitHub repository:

### What we ask next

For UBC:
- Confirm in writing whether any active agreement exists with Dongguk (exchange, mobility, MOU).
- If none, request delisting from Dongguk‚Äôs page and post an interim advisory/clarification for students.

For Dongguk University:
- Immediately correct public partner listings; publish a dated, verified partner roster.
- Provide a public explanation for how false partner entries remained for 145+ days.

For Korean oversight bodies (MOE; IEQAS program office; KCUE):
- Initiate an external audit of public partner listings across IEQAS‚Äëcertified institutions.
- Re‚Äëevaluate IEQAS certification criteria/enforcement; integrate sexual‚Äëviolence risk metrics (KWDI 2020) and partner verification checks.

For Global Affairs Canada / Embassy in Seoul:
- Issue a student safety advisory noting disputed partnerships and consent‚Äëlaw/defamation risks highlighted by HRW.
- Provide a public, dated response to our Apr 27 notification.

For ATIXA and partner institutions globally:
- Treat partner‚Äëlist claims from Korean universities as unverified until independently confirmed.
- Consider interim suspension of exchange relationships where partner‚Äëlist inaccuracies and high risk indicators co‚Äëexist.

---

### Next steps (process transparency)

- FOI filings: File requests to University of British Columbia (BC FIPPA), University of Manitoba (MB FIPPA), Toronto Metropolitan University and Centennial College (Ontario FIPPA), and Mount Allison University (RTIPPA; plus NB PETL) for any Dongguk agreements or communications (2015‚Äìpresent). Results will be linked in the institutional‚Äëprotection brief.
- ATIP: File to Global Affairs Canada for Dongguk‚Äërelated partnership/student‚Äësafety records (Apr 2025‚Äìpresent).
- Evidence publication: Post all responses and archives to our GitHub/email repository and update this article with confirmations or denials.

### Why we may notify all Dongguk‚Äëlisted partners in ~72 hours

Multiple apparent false Canadian partners on Dongguk's site, combined with **150+ days of coordinated silence across two countries**, obligate us to warn other universities who may unknowingly be leveraged as reputational cover. We will circulate a brief with:
- Archived UBC pages and Dongguk partner pages: [Live](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554) | [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20250904022732/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554) | [Archive.today](https://archive.md/tTgvE)
- Screenshot set and WACZ proofs
- HRW/consent‚Äëlaw/defamation context and KWDI risk baseline
- Our outreach timeline and unanswered right‚Äëof‚Äëreply notices

---

### Appendix: baseline risk for arts/culture programs in Korea

Korean government data (KWDI 2020) indicates extremely high sexual‚Äëviolence exposure for arts/culture programs (61.5% of women, 17.2% of men). These are the very pipelines recruiting international students into entertainment‚Äëadjacent sectors. Any misleading partner claims that steer students into these programs without accurate risk communication are unacceptable.
