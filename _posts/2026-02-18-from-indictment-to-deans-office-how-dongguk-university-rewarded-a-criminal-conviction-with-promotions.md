*February 18, 2026 — Gender Watchdog*

**A university founded on Buddhist principles of truthfulness (진리), compassion (자비), and righteousness (정직) indicted a professor in 2015, watched him be convicted of bid-rigging in 2017, and responded by promoting him twice — the second time to Dean.**

This is not speculation. Every step of this timeline is documented across major Korean news outlets and Dongguk University's own institutional history page.

## The Man at the Center

Tcha Seung-jai (차승재) is not a minor figure in Korean cinema. The Hollywood Reporter identified him as the **founder and co-CEO of Sidus FNH**, the production house behind some of Korea's most internationally recognized films. He served three terms as **President of the Korean Film Producers Association (KFPA)** — the position that effectively controls industry-wide hiring standards, blacklisting power, and access to co-production networks across Asia and beyond.

We have documented at length how he simultaneously leveraged corporate control, academic authority, industry gatekeeping, and association leadership into what we term a **"Quadruple Coercion"** model — a structure that creates near-total dependency for any career-seeking student at Dongguk's Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents.<sup>1</sup> His company Sidus FNH shared physical facilities with the very department where he taught, a fact confirmed by Dongguk University's own official website before it was quietly archived.<sup>2</sup>

That analysis is documented elsewhere. This post is about something that has not been fully assembled in public until now: the **criminal conviction timeline**, and Dongguk's remarkable institutional response to it.

## June 2015: Indictment as a Professor

Korean media first reported Tcha Seung-jai's indictment in June 2015. Sports World identified him as `현 동국대 영상대학원 교수` — *current professor of Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Image* — at the time of his arrest.<sup>3</sup> Sisafocus covered the same story, confirming his academic position and the nature of the allegations.<sup>4</sup>

The charges stemmed from a scheme involving government education subsidies routed through a film personnel education institution in Seoul. The alleged misappropriation totalled approximately **350 million KRW** — roughly CAD $340,000 at current exchange rates — drawn from public funds explicitly designated for film industry workforce training.

The political economics of this matter. These were not private monies. They were taxpayer-funded subsidies intended to develop Korean cinema's human capital. The allegation was that those funds were manipulated at the procurement stage — vendors selected not on merit but through coordination.

---

## 2017: Conviction for Bid-Rigging

When the case reached trial, Tcha Seung-jai was **acquitted of the embezzlement charges** but **convicted of bid-rigging** in the same government subsidy program — found to have manipulated which vendors received contracts funded by public education money.

A criminal conviction. Not an allegation. Not a settlement. A court verdict.

Dongguk University did not announce his departure. He continued as a professor.

## 2020: First Promotion — Research Institute Director

Three years after his 2017 conviction, Dong-A Ilbo, Kyunghyang Shinmun, and Hankyung (Korea Economic Daily) all reported a March 2020 Dongguk personnel announcement: Tcha Seung-jai had been appointed **Director of the Image Culture & Contents Research Institute** (영상문화콘텐츠연구원장).<sup>5, 6, 7</sup>

Three of Korea's largest national newspapers treated this as a routine university personnel notice. None mentioned the 2017 conviction. The university issued the announcement without comment on his criminal record.

He had gone from convicted felon to research institute director in 36 months.

---

## 2023: Second Promotion — 11th Dean of Film & Video Production

On March 2, 2023 — **six years after his criminal conviction** — Dongguk's Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents formally installed Tcha Seung-jai as its **11th Dean** (제11대 원장, 영화영상제작학과 차승재 교수 취임).

This promotion was:

- Announced by **Yonhap News Agency**, Korea's official state wire service<sup>8</sup>
- Confirmed by **Business Post**, **Financial News (Fnnews)**, **Veritas Alpha**, and **University Journal**<sup>9, 10, 11, 12</sup>
- Recorded permanently in **Dongguk Graduate School's own official institutional history page** at `dic.dongguk.edu/page/1042`<sup>13</sup> — which reads verbatim:

> `2023.03 · 제11대 원장에 영화영상제작학과 차승재 교수 취임`
> *(March 2023 — Professor Tcha Seung-jai of the Film & Video Production Department inaugurated as 11th Director/Dean)*

The appointment was not challenged. It was celebrated.

## What Dongguk's Response Tells Us

Every institution faces difficult decisions about employees who encounter the legal system. The question is what the institution's response reveals about its actual values — not its stated ones.

Dongguk University did not quietly accept Tcha Seung-jai's resignation after his 2017 conviction. It did not demote him, place him on administrative leave, conduct a review, or make any public accounting of the conflict between a bid-rigging conviction and a position of authority over students whose careers depend on industry access he controls.

Instead, it promoted him. Twice. Into progressively more influential positions of institutional authority — over research, over graduate programs, over the academic futures of the next generation of Korean filmmakers.

This is not ambivalence. This is endorsement.

Dongguk University's founding institution, the **Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism**, describes the university's educational mission through three interlocking principles: truth (진리), compassion (자비), and righteousness (정직). The promotion of a criminally convicted figure into the Dean's office — where he exercises authority over students already documented by the Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI) as experiencing sexual violence at a rate of **61.5%**<sup>14</sup> — represents a sustained institutional failure to embody any of those three values in practice.

The KWDI's 2020 report — produced by a Korean government-linked research body — assigned film departments the **highest risk rating (81/100)** of all academic disciplines. The university is not unaware of this data. It exists within the same government certification system that reviews and renews Dongguk's IEQAS (International Education Quality Assurance System) status year after year.

## The Silencing Mechanism

When Gender Watchdog first documented the co-location of Sidus FNH within Dongguk's film department building — and Tcha Seung-jai's simultaneous corporate and academic roles — Sidus responded not with a rebuttal of the facts but with a **criminal defamation threat** through the law firm Shinwon.<sup>15</sup>

The legal notice, sent May 27, 2025, demanded retraction of our documentation and threatened criminal complaint under South Korea's defamation statutes, which, unlike those of most liberal democracies, permit criminal prosecution for statements that are true but deemed injurious to reputation.

Sidus's letter asserted that the company had relocated its office from the Chungmuro Visual Media Center more than fifteen years prior. Dongguk's archived official website — captured April 8, 2025 — stated that the Film & Digital Media department building "houses Sidus FNH, one of Korea's top 5 film production companies."

One of these statements is false. The legal threat came from the party whose statement contradicts the archived institutional record.

We have analyzed this corporate panic response in detail elsewhere.<sup>16</sup> The salient point here: institutions that have nothing to hide do not respond to factual documentation with criminal defamation threats. They respond with facts.

## Why This Matters for International Students and Partners

Universities that partner with Dongguk — through exchange agreements, co-production treaties, or research MOUs — are entering an institutional relationship with a graduate school currently administered by a person convicted of manipulating public education funds.

The international students most at risk are not just from Korea. They come from around the world, with the largest populations hailing from **China and Vietnam**, alongside **Japan's Zainichi Korean community** — a group whose mistreatment exposes how deeply discrimination runs even against those of Korean descent.

On October 31, 2025, The PIE News reported that South Korea had reached its target of hosting **300,000 international students** nearly two years ahead of schedule. Yet this rapid expansion has occurred without the safety infrastructure to protect them. These 300,000 students — whose visa status, language barriers, and social isolation make them structurally vulnerable — are entering an ecosystem where the Quadruple Coercion model Tcha embodies is standard operating procedure.<sup>1</sup>

We have been documenting this racialized dimension of the crisis since April 2025. Victim testimony collected through Xiaohongshu (China's "Little Red Book" platform) details how faculty exploit visa vulnerability as a mechanism of compliance.<sup>17</sup> These accounts are not anonymized rumors; they represent a pattern consistent with the KWDI data, consistent with the 2025 Professor F case reported by Maeil Kyeongjae, and consistent with the structural access architecture Tcha Seung-jai's appointments have maintained and expanded.

The Korean government certified this institution. The Korean government has received our full evidence file since April 10, 2025 — **more than 300 days** of documented silence.

## The Public Record

This timeline is assembled entirely from public sources: Korean news archives, Dongguk University's own institutional pages, and Yonhap's official wire records. None of this required investigative access. It required only someone willing to look, to connect, and to say clearly what the pattern means.

Dongguk University promoted a criminally convicted professor to Dean. It did so six years after his conviction, through multiple steps, with official announcements covered by national media. The institution's international accreditation certifiers, its Korean government overseers, and its international academic partners received this appointment as routine.

We do not accept that it is routine. And we will continue to document why.
