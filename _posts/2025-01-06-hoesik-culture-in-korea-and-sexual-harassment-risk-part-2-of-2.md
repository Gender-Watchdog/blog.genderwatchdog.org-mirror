# Professor–Student Hoesik Scandals in Korea

While some universities have begun to discourage faculty-student drinking, the **tradition of professors taking students to hoesik persists** at many Korean institutions. Several scandals highlight the risks:

## 1. 2023 Seoul National University (SNU) Film Department

In 2023, a **film department professor at SNU** was reported for sexually assaulting female students **during a hoesik** that followed an off-campus class trip. 

After the university's initial investigation was criticized as inadequate, the Ministry of Education launched its own review, resulting in a **3-month suspension** for the professor [[source](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2023/06/181_352456.html)].

## 2. 2022 Korea National University of Arts

In 2022, Korea National University of Arts (K-Arts) faced a major scandal when allegations emerged that a **traditional music professor** had **sexually violated** multiple female students during private drinking gatherings over several years.

The university eventually dismissed the professor after **student protests** called attention to the initial mishandling of reports [[source](https://m.khan.co.kr/national/national-general/article/202202061357001)].

## 3. 2016-2021 Dongguk University Faculty-Student Drinking Incidents

Between 2016 and 2021, **multiple faculty members** at Dongguk University were disciplined for sexual violence that occurred during or after hoesik with students. 

The university responded in 2022 by implementing **stricter rules requiring formal approval** for any off-campus faculty-student gatherings involving alcohol [[source](https://www.dongguktimes.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=6818)].

## 4. 2021 Korea University Business School

In 2021, a **senior business professor** at Korea University faced allegations of sexual violence toward female students during **one-on-one dinner meetings**. 

The case drew attention because the professor was a **prominent figure in Korean business circles**. While he denied wrongdoing, the case led to broader scrutiny of how universities handle sexual violence allegations made by students against influential faculty [[source](https://www.edaily.co.kr/news/read?newsId=01281766629121456)].

## 5. 2019 Yonsei University Ethics Professor

In a particularly ironic case, an **ethics professor** at Yonsei University was fired after being found to have sexually violated multiple female students during **off-campus drinking sessions**. 

Students reported that the professor had justified the drinking meetings as **"mentoring sessions"** required for their professional development [[source](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=4159159)].

# Policy Responses to Faculty–Student Drinking Scandals

These scandals have triggered various institutional responses:

## Seoul National University

Since 2019, SNU has **recommended against** faculty-student drinking gatherings and required drinking events to include a **"designated guardian"** similar to the Navy's "hoesik-jikimi" system [[source](https://ddc.snu.ac.kr/front/en/com/cmm/hpcm/39)].

## Korea University

In 2022, Korea University took a more decisive approach by **completely banning** faculty from consuming alcohol with current students, stating: _"Any consumption of alcohol between faculty and enrolled students is strictly prohibited, regardless of context"_ [[source](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2022/04/113_327541.html)].

## Ministry of Education Guidelines

The Ministry of Education issued guidelines in 2022 urging all universities to:

1. Limit or prohibit faculty-student hoesik
2. Establish clear reporting mechanisms for sexual violence
3. Implement regular training on sexual violence prevention
4. Perform annual surveys on sexual violence incidence

Universities were required to submit implementation plans by 2023 [[source](https://www.moe.go.kr/boardCnts/viewRenew.do?boardID=294&boardSeq=89528&lev=0&searchType=null&statusYN=W&page=1&s=moe&m=020402&opType=N)].

## Corporate Korea's Hoesik Reform

In parallel, many Korean corporations have begun reforming their own hoesik culture:

* **Samsung** implemented a "119 rule" – 1 type of alcohol, finished by 9 PM, in 1 location only [[source](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/12/10/national/socialAffairs/South-Korea-hoesik-workplace/20231210175110287.html)]
* **LG** abolished mandatory hoesik attendance [[source](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/12/10/national/socialAffairs/South-Korea-hoesik-workplace/20231210175110287.html)]
* **Naver** and **Kakao** replaced drinking gatherings with daytime team-building activities [[source](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/12/10/national/socialAffairs/South-Korea-hoesik-workplace/20231210175110287.html)]

These changes reflect a broader societal shift in Korea that recognizes how traditional hoesik practices can enable sexual violence and other forms of misconduct.
