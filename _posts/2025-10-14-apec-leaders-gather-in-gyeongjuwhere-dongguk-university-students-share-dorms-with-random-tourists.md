**October 14, 2025**

From October 27 to November 1, 2025, APEC Economic Leaders' Week will take place in Gyeongju, Republic of Korea‚Äîbringing together leaders from 21 Pacific Rim nations for dialogue on digital economy cooperation, AI governance, and regional integration.¬π In the same city, at Dongguk University's WISE campus, Chinese international students are posting desperate accounts on social media: their "student housing" doubles as a budget hostel, with backpackers and tourist families sharing hallways, bathrooms, and common spaces with paying students who were promised safe, dedicated student accommodation.

**This is the same Dongguk University where we documented systematic partnership fraud: 2 out of 5 Canadian partnerships falsified on their official website, with 150+ days of institutional silence from universities and governments across two countries when confronted with evidence.**¬π¬≥ ¬π‚Å¥

This is not a rumor. This is documented on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), China's primary social media platform, where multiple Dongguk WISE students are posting real-time accounts of housing exploitation, financial fraud, racist harassment, and administrative abandonment‚Äîall while university leadership faces criminal prosecution and Korea positions itself as an "AI superpower" through APEC's digital economy agenda.

The proximity is not coincidental. The pattern is structural.

**English Translation:**

> **New Problem at Dongguk University Off-Campus Dormitories**
> 
> All along, everyone believed the off-campus dormitories were entirely reserved by the school for student housing, but starting in October, many strangers appeared in the off-campus dorms, which explains why the off-campus dormitory management demanded students merge rooms.
> 
> Specifically, starting in October, unfamiliar faces began appearing in the off-campus dorms in the mornings. These people are not Chinese students, nor are they Korean students‚Äîthey are customers the off-campus dorm owner accepted through booking platforms. Some are backpackers, some are families. They are living in the off-campus dormitories together with students.
> 
> These non-student personnel living mixed with students‚Äîis this what the school calls "ensuring student safety"?
> 
> They continue using empty rooms as a youth hostel to accept guests. No wonder they demanded students merge dormitories, forcibly charge extra fees, and refuse to give empty rooms to students.

**English Translation:**

> **Warning about Dongguk WISE transfer program!!!!**
> 
> This school's behavior is ugly. Not only do they refuse refunds for off-campus housing students didn't occupy, now they're demanding remaining students in 4-person rooms pay extra to make up the difference!! (Because many students came, saw the off-campus 4-person room environment, and fled. The school probably promised the landlord a certain profit amount, so now they're trying every means to extract it from students)
> 
> On-campus dorms are not only ridiculously expensive but also lack private bathrooms. Weekend cleaning staff don't work, so toilets become a disaster‚Äîfeces outside the toilet, cigarette butts in sinks.
> 
> Management staff are all part-time senior students who know nothing. The school's international office pretends to be deaf and blind, acting like they can't see student messages.

### Report 6: Mandatory Housing in Exploitative Conditions (October 11, 2025)

This is the same post as Report 5, but it reveals something even more alarming: **according to multiple student reports posted on October 11, 2025, the university is making off-campus housing mandatory for all incoming students**, despite knowing conditions are terrible.

**Original Chinese Text (Additional Excerpt):**‚Å∏

Even the intermediaries are afraid they can't recruit people, saying next year there might be a small amount of on-campus dorms available‚Äîbut who will take responsibility if there aren't any?
> 
> 2. When school started, intermediaries asked their own on-campus dorm students to swap to off-campus dorms. No one paid attention to them.

  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 0.9em;">Student report revealing university will require all 2026 incoming students to live in off-campus dorms with "very poor" conditions (October 11, 2025)</p>
</div>

**The Trap Closes:**

This transforms the exploitation from opportunistic to systematic:
- **Current students:** Exploited through tourist mixing, no refunds, forced extra fees
- **Future students:** Will be REQUIRED to enter exploitative conditions as a condition of enrollment
- **University awareness:** Even intermediaries openly worried they "can't recruit people" because environment is "very poor"
- **No alternatives:** Starting 2026, all new international students MUST live in off-campus dorms
- **Attempted forced transfers:** University tried to make current on-campus students swap to off-campus (students refused)

**Legal implications:** Requiring students to accept unsafe housing as an enrollment condition may constitute consumer fraud and a duty‚Äëof‚Äëcare violation under Korean law and should be investigated. The university cannot credibly claim "students chose off-campus housing" if the policy is mandatory.

**Why they're doing this:** The university and landlords have discovered a revenue optimization model that works‚Äîso they're making it mandatory to guarantee captive supply of students for the tourist/student mixed housing scheme.

---

## The Exploitation Mechanism: Revenue Optimization at Student Expense

The housing exploitation pattern is methodical:

### Phase 1: Recruit Maximum Students
- Aggressive marketing of "Study in Korea" programs targeting Chinese students
- Promise safe, dedicated student housing
- Collect full semester/year housing fees upfront

### Phase 2: Squeeze Occupancy
- When students flee poor conditions, remaining students forced to pay extra
- No refunds for students who leave
- Force room consolidation to free up "inventory"

### Phase 3: Monetize Vacancy
- List "freed" rooms on tourist booking platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.)
- Accept backpackers, families, random tourists
- Students discover strangers in hallways, bathrooms, common areas
- University claims "off-campus = not our responsibility"

### Financial Math:
**Student contracts:** ‚Ç©500,000/month √ó 4 students = ‚Ç©2,000,000/room/month (hypothetical)

**After consolidation:**
- 2 students forced to pay ‚Ç©750,000/month each = ‚Ç©1,500,000 (student revenue)
- 2 "freed" beds rented nightly to tourists at ‚Ç©50,000/night √ó 30 days = ‚Ç©3,000,000 (tourist revenue)
- **Total room revenue:** ‚Ç©4,500,000/month (225% of original)

Students pay more. Landlord profits more. University avoids liability ("off-campus housing is student's choice"). Tourists get cheap accommodation. Everyone wins‚Äîexcept the students who were promised safe, dedicated student housing.

---

## Legal and Safety Violations

### 1. Housing Code Violations
- **Mixed-use without disclosure:** Operating as both student housing AND commercial lodging
- **Zoning violations:** Student housing vs. tourist accommodation have different regulatory requirements in most jurisdictions
- **Lease fraud:** Students contracted for "student housing" but receiving hostel-style mixed accommodation

### 2. Duty of Care Breach
- **No background checks:** Random tourists/backpackers have access to student living spaces
- **Security failure:** Students told housing is "safe" while strangers have building access
- **Legal obligation:** Korean universities have duty of care to provide safe housing for international students, especially in university-arranged accommodation‚Åπ

### 3. Immigration/Visa Implications
- Student visas often require **verified student housing documentation**
- If housing contract states "student residence" but facility actually operates as mixed-use commercial lodging, this constitutes potential **visa documentation fraud**
- Chinese students on Korean student visas living in unlicensed commercial accommodation face immigration liability

### 4. Consumer Protection Violations
- **No refunds for services not rendered:** Students fleeing unsafe conditions not refunded
- **Forced additional payments:** Remaining students charged extra without contractual basis
- **Service misrepresentation:** "Student housing" sold, hostel environment delivered

---

## The Leadership Context: Criminal Prosecution During APEC Preparations

While students reported these conditions (September-October 2025), Dongguk WISE campus leadership faced its own crisis:

### WISE Campus President Under Criminal Investigation

**Verified by Korean News Sources:**‚Åµ

The president of Dongguk University's WISE Campus and a nursing college professor were investigated by police and sent to prosecutors for violating medical laws. The case involves:

- **What happened:** The nursing professor administered intravenous fluids to the president at his home residence, rather than inside a medical facility
- **Why it's illegal:** Under Korean law, medical procedures like IV injections are only legal inside approved medical institutions; performing such procedures at home is illegal without special permission
- **Additional violations:** Nurses can only perform procedures under licensed doctor supervision; taking medical supplies out of hospitals is also prohibited
- **Timeline:** Began approximately two months after president's inauguration; investigation concluded September 2025

  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 0.9em;">Student comment on Xiaohongshu referencing Korean news coverage of WISE campus president's criminal investigation (September 2025)</p>
</div>

**Current Status:**
- Both president and professor referred for prosecution
- University pursuing internal disciplinary action
- Investigation included hospital staff who provided IV supplies

**Relevance to Student Reports:**

Students noted (September 29 XHS post): "Â≠¶Ê†°Ê†°ÈïøÊ∂âÂ´åËøùËßÑÂú®Êé•ÂèóË∞ÉÊü•" ("The school's principal is under investigation for suspected violations")‚Äîthis was happening **concurrently** with:
- Tourist/backpacker mixed housing (reported October 4)
- Forced extra fees on students (reported September 29)
- Racist harassment (reported September 23)
- Administrative abandonment ("international office pretends to be deaf and blind")

**Leadership operating under criminal prosecution = predictable governance neglect.**

---

## Institutional Capture: How Prestige Priorities Create Exploitation Conditions

This is not isolated incompetence. This is structural institutional capture.

### The Pattern:

#### 1. Prestige Projects Consume Leadership Attention
- **APEC 2025 hosting:** Korea's year-long diplomatic showcase
- **APEC Economic Leaders' Week (October 27 - November 1, 2025):** Held in Gyeongju, same city as Dongguk WISE campus¬π‚Å∞
- **K-content promotion:** Celebrity-studded committees, variety show appearances
- **"AI superpower" positioning:** Digital economy agenda through APEC framework

#### 2. Infrastructure and Student Welfare Neglected
- **Data center fires:** 647 government services offline for a month (reported elsewhere)¬π¬π
- **Housing exploitation:** Students sharing space with random tourists
- **No oversight:** Off-campus housing operators maximize profit with zero accountability
- **Administrative abandonment:** "International office pretends to be deaf and blind"

#### 3. Vulnerable Populations Become Profit Centers
- **International students as revenue source:** Maximize enrollment, minimize support
- **Captive market abuse:** Students can't easily switch mid-semester
- **Language barriers:** Chinese students struggle to navigate Korean legal/administrative systems
- **Visa dependency:** Fear of jeopardizing student visa status prevents complaints

### The Governance Failure Mechanism:

**Why doesn't Dongguk intervene?**

1. **Plausible deniability:** "Off-campus housing is student's personal choice"
2. **Revenue dependency:** Landlord contracts may generate kickbacks or reduce university housing burden
3. **Attention scarcity:** Leadership focused on APEC prestige, not student safety
4. **Legal vulnerability:** President under criminal prosecution ‚Üí governance capacity compromised
5. **Diplomatic optics:** Don't risk scandal right before APEC Leaders' Meeting

**Result:** Students exploited, tourists profit, landlords profit, university avoids liability, Korea projects "AI superpower" image to APEC leaders‚Äîall while students in the same city live in hostel conditions.

## The APEC Proximity: A Unique Accountability Opportunity

**Critical Timeline:**

- **October 4, 2025:** Student reports tourists in housing
- **October 7, 2025:** Student reports filthy holiday conditions
- **October 11, 2025:** Student reports instructor problems
- **October 14, 2025:** Today (this post published)
- **October 27 - November 1, 2025:** APEC Economic Leaders' Week in Gyeongju

**Geographic Context:**

APEC Economic Leaders' Week will be held in Gyeongju, Republic of Korea‚Äîthe same city where Dongguk University's WISE Campus is located. While APEC events are not being hosted at Dongguk University, the proximity creates an unprecedented opportunity:

- **APEC venue:** Gyeongju city (exact venue TBD)¬π‚Å∞
- **Dongguk WISE Campus:** Also in Gyeongju, where Chinese students report exploitation
- **Distance:** Both within the same city limits

This geographic overlap means APEC leaders will be physically present in the same city where documented student exploitation is occurring.

### An Unprecedented Accountability Opportunity

**To APEC Leaders Attending the October 27-November 1 Meetings:**

You will be meeting in Gyeongju‚Äîthe same city where a local university's international students are experiencing:
- Sharing housing with random tourists and backpackers
- Forced to pay extra fees when classmates flee unsafe conditions
- Denied refunds for unusable housing
- Subjected to racist harassment with no administrative response
- Living in filthy conditions during holidays with no support
- Taught by overwhelmed, first-time instructors in explosively overcrowded classes

**While the university's president is under criminal prosecution for medical law violations.**

You will sit in conference rooms discussing "digital economy cooperation" and "AI governance frameworks" while students in the same city experience governance collapse in real time‚Äîat a university with falsified international partnerships, documented sexual violence cover-ups, and now systematic exploitation of vulnerable international students.

### Verification Request to APEC Delegations:

During APEC Economic Leaders' Week in Gyeongju (October 27 - November 1), we request:

1. **Site visit to WISE Campus:** Inspect off-campus housing conditions in the same city where you're meeting
2. **Student interviews:** Meet Chinese students willing to share experiences (anonymously if needed)
3. **Documentation review:** Examine housing contracts vs. actual conditions
4. **Administrative inquiry:** Ask Dongguk leadership about tourist/student mixed housing policy

**Why This Matters for APEC's Digital Economy Agenda:**

If Korea cannot ensure basic housing safety and contractual integrity for international students at a university in the same city where APEC leaders are meeting to discuss AI governance, how credible is Korea's claim to lead regional digital economy cooperation?

**AI systems amplify existing governance patterns.** If exploitation systems operate unchecked at human scale, AI deployment will catastrophically accelerate those same exploitation dynamics.

The geographic proximity is a test: Will APEC leaders verify governance capacity in the host city, or accept Korea's "AI superpower" claims at face value while students kilometers away document systematic exploitation?

## Why Chinese Students Cannot Safely Escalate Domestically

### Structural Barriers to Justice:

1. **Language barriers:** Korean legal and administrative systems difficult to navigate
2. **Visa dependency:** Fear that complaints will jeopardize student visa status
3. **Cultural isolation:** Limited support networks outside Chinese student community
4. **University stonewalling:** "International office pretends to be deaf and blind"
5. **Financial pressure:** Already paid non-refundable fees; can't afford to leave
6. **Time constraints:** Need to complete program for degree recognition in China

### Why Xiaohongshu Posts Matter:

Chinese social media (Xiaohongshu, WeChat) is where these students can safely document experiences in their native language, reaching Chinese audiences considering study abroad. But these posts have limited reach to Korean authorities, international press, or diplomatic oversight bodies.

**These students are not silent. They are systematically unheard.**

## The Broader Institutional Capture Thesis

Dongguk WISE housing exploitation is one data point in a larger pattern we've been documenting:

### Pattern of Institutional Capture in Korea's "AI Superpower" Push:

1. **Prestige over governance:** APEC hosting, K-content promotion, celebrity committees while infrastructure burns (literally‚Äîdata centers)

2. **Exploitation economies normalized:** Sex industry pipelines through entertainment training, cosmetic surgery debt-bondage, hospitality industry exploitation

3. **International partnerships falsified:** We've documented Dongguk falsifying Canadian university partnerships (2 out of 5 confirmed fake)‚ÄîUBC's official partnerships page does not list Dongguk despite Dongguk claiming UBC as a partner, plus one anonymous Canadian university that explicitly denied any partnership agreement. UBC remains unresponsive to 5+ months of email outreach and X.com mentions¬π¬≥ ¬π‚Å¥

4. **Diplomatic cover-up:** When we notified Canadian universities and diplomats, response was "sensitive matter"‚Äîdiplomatic language for "we know, we're not acting publicly"

5. **Vulnerable populations targeted:** International students, aspiring entertainers, sex trafficking survivors, LGBT individuals‚Äîall exploited by systems claiming to "develop" or "protect" them

6. **AI deployment without fixing governance:** Korea wants to be "AI superpower" while basic institutional integrity collapses

**The WISE campus housing scandal is not peripheral‚Äîit is demonstrative of the core governance failures that make Korea's AI ambitions dangerous.**

## What Needs to Happen

### Immediate Actions (Before October 27 APEC Meeting):

1. **APEC delegations:** Request site visit to WISE campus and student interviews
2. **Korean education ministry:** Emergency audit of WISE campus housing arrangements
3. **Chinese embassy in Korea:** Verify student housing safety for Chinese nationals
4. **Tourist booking platforms:** Investigate if WISE campus dorms listed as tourist accommodation
5. **International press:** Cover this story before APEC leaders arrive

### Structural Reforms:

1. **Mandatory housing audits:** All university-arranged international student housing subject to regular inspection
2. **Refund guarantees:** Students fleeing unsafe conditions entitled to pro-rated refunds
3. **Contractual clarity:** "Student housing" cannot legally operate as mixed-use tourist accommodation
4. **Administrative accountability:** University international offices required to respond to student complaints within 48 hours
5. **Visa protections:** International students reporting safety violations guaranteed visa security during investigations
6. **Enforcement:** Landlords operating student housing as unlicensed hostels should face investigation for potential fraud and regulatory violations

### Accountability for Dongguk:

1. **Suspend mandatory housing policy:** Immediately rescind requirement that all 2026 incoming students live in off-campus dorms
2. **Leadership resignation:** President under criminal prosecution cannot credibly oversee student safety
3. **Financial penalties:** University fined for allowing exploitation of international students
4. **Partnership suspensions:** International universities should suspend Dongguk partnerships pending reforms (as some Canadian universities already have)
5. **International scrutiny:** APEC delegations should verify conditions in Gyeongju before endorsing Korea's AI governance claims

## A Message to Chinese Students at Dongguk WISE

**You are not alone. Your documentation on Xiaohongshu is powerful evidence.**

We are amplifying your reports to:
- APEC leaders meeting in Gyeongju October 27 - November 1 (same city as your campus)
- International press covering Korea's APEC hosting
- Chinese diplomatic representatives in Korea
- International student safety organizations
- Korean education authorities

**Safety Recommendations:**

1. **Document everything:** Screenshots, photos, videos, dates, names
2. **Share with trusted networks:** Other students, family in China, lawyers if accessible
3. **Contact Chinese embassy:** Report unsafe housing conditions to consular services
4. **Explore legal options:** Consumer protection laws may provide recourse
5. **Do not accept guilt:** You were sold fraudulent services; you are not at fault

**If you need to leave for safety reasons:**

Contact these organizations for international student support:
- Your home country's embassy/consulate in Korea
- International student advocacy organizations
- Legal aid organizations serving international students in Korea

**Your Xiaohongshu posts are evidence of systemic failure.** They are not just complaints‚Äîthey are documentation of governance collapse at a university hosting international diplomatic summits while claiming to lead regional AI development.

## Conclusion: The Geographic Proximity Test

From October 27 to November 1, 2025, APEC Economic Leaders' Week will take place in Gyeongju, Republic of Korea. In the same city, at Dongguk University's WISE campus:

- International students share housing with random tourists
- **Starting 2026, all new students will be REQUIRED to live in off-campus dorms the university knows are "very poor"**
- Students fleeing unsafe conditions are denied refunds and remaining students forced to pay extra
- Racist harassment goes unaddressed
- Administrative offices ignore student complaints
- Campus leadership operates under criminal prosecution
- The university has falsified international partnerships (2 of 5 Canadian partners confirmed fake)
- Sexual violence cover-ups documented

**This is not a peripheral scandal. This is a diagnostic test.**

If Korea cannot ensure basic housing safety and contractual integrity at a university in the same city where it's hosting APEC leaders to discuss AI governance, Korea cannot credibly claim readiness to lead regional digital economy cooperation.

**AI amplifies existing governance patterns.** Exploitation systems operating unchecked at human scale will be catastrophically accelerated by AI deployment.

APEC leaders have a unique opportunity: you will be physically present in Gyeongju during a documented governance crisis at a local university. The students documenting exploitation on Xiaohongshu are in the same city where you're discussing "AI governance."

**Verification is simple:** Visit the WISE campus in Gyeongju. Interview students. Review housing contracts vs. actual conditions.

The Chinese students posting on Xiaohongshu are not asking for dramatic intervention. They are asking for basic contractual integrity: housing contracts should deliver housing, not hostel conditions. Safety promises should mean safety, not mixed occupation with random tourists. Administrative offices should respond, not "pretend to be deaf and blind."

**These are not aspirational goals. These are baseline institutional competencies.**

If Korea cannot deliver baseline competencies in the city hosting APEC while claiming AI leadership, APEC leaders should reconsider Korea's suitability for regional digital economy governance roles.

The students have documented the failure. APEC leaders will be physically present in the same city October 27 - November 1. The test is simple: will you look?
