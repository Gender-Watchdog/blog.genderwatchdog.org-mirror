Dear KOFIC and relevant authorities,

We are writing on behalf of the Gender Watchdog Research Collective, an international advocacy group focused on sexual violence prevention, institutional accountability, and global compliance in higher education and the film industry. This message is being forwarded to you, as well as to major international film organizations, platforms, and distributors, in light of urgent and systemic concerns regarding Sidus FNH and its relationship with Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents.

**Summary of Concerns:**
- Multiple, credible allegations of sexual violence, cover-ups, and retaliation at Dongguk University, particularly within the Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents, are now documented and under international scrutiny.
- Sidus FNH shares the Chungmuro Video Center building with Dongguk University, blurring the boundaries between industry and academia and increasing risk to students and young professionals ([Dongguk University source](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;)).
- The Korean film industry has a well-documented, ongoing crisis of sexual violence and harassment, as detailed in the 2019 research summary ([link](http://solido.kr/wp-content/uploads/2019-Sexual-Violence%C2%B7Sexual-Harassment-in-the-korean-film-industry-Research-summary.pdf?ckattempt=1)).
- There are credible allegations of falsified international partnerships and misuse of public funds at Dongguk University, with Sidus FNH implicated by association and proximity.
- Recent high-profile cases (e.g., Kim Ki-duk) demonstrate the industry's failure to protect victims and the urgent need for institutional accountability ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/07/three-woman-accuse-korean-director-kim-ki-duk-rape-assault)).

**Immediate Demands:**
1. **Immediate Suspension:**
   - All Korean films (and, where applicable, foreign films) made or distributed by Sidus FNH must be immediately suspended from screening, distribution, and festival participation until a full, independent investigation is completed into:
     - Sexual violence and cover-ups at Dongguk University and Sidus FNH
     - Falsified international partnerships and public funds misuse
     - The role of Sidus FNH in enabling or failing to prevent these abuses
2. **Transparency and Accountability:**
   - KOFIC must explain why Sidus FNH was permitted to share space with Dongguk University despite the known, documented risks and ongoing sexual violence crisis in the Korean film industry.
   - KOFIC must outline concrete steps to support and protect victims who come forward, including students, alumni, and staff, and ensure that all perpetrators (including professors, Sidus FNH staff, alumni, and administrators) are investigated and prosecuted.
3. **International Notification:**
   - This message and the attached documentation are being shared with all major international film festivals, platforms (Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc.), distributors, and film organizations in the top international student source countries, as well as with advocacy and compliance networks.

**Sidus FNH Film List:**
Below is a partial list of Korean and foreign films made or distributed by Sidus FNH, compiled from public sources and the official Sidus FNH movie list ([http://sidus.com/eng/full_movie_list.asp](http://sidus.com/eng/full_movie_list.asp)). We demand that all such films be suspended from screening and distribution until the investigation is complete.

**Key Questions for KOFIC:**
- Why was Sidus FNH allowed to share space with Dongguk University given the well-documented risks and ongoing sexual violence crisis in the Korean film industry?
- What immediate steps will KOFIC take to suspend all Sidus FNH films and protect the public, students, and industry workers?
- How will KOFIC support and protect victims who come forward, including students, alumni, and staff, and ensure that all perpetrators (including professors, Sidus FNH staff, alumni, and administrators) are investigated and prosecuted?
- What reforms will KOFIC implement to prevent future abuses and ensure full compliance with international standards for sexual violence prevention, ESG, and public accountability?

We expect a prompt, public response within one week. Silence or inaction will be documented and shared with all relevant domestic and international partners, platforms, and advocacy networks.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Research Collective
