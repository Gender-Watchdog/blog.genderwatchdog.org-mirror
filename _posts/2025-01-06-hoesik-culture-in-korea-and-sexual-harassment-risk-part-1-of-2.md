Korea's work and school social life often revolves around **hoesik (회식)** – group dinners or drinking gatherings attended by colleagues or students and superiors. These events are meant to build camaraderie, but they frequently involve heavy alcohol consumption and rigid hierarchies.

Research and surveys have documented that this drinking culture can create conditions ripe for sexual violence: in one study, **87% of employees reported that sexual violence was common at hoesik gatherings** [[source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357030838_KOREA%27S_DRINKING_CULTURE_WHEN_AN_ORGANIZATIONAL_SOCIALIZATION_TOOL_THREATENS_WORKPLACE_WELL-BEING)].

Female participants often face uncomfortable gender roles; for example, **76% of women surveyed said it was "very common" for female employees to be expected to sit next to male supervisors and pour drinks at hoesik** [[source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357030838_KOREA%27S_DRINKING_CULTURE_WHEN_AN_ORGANIZATIONAL_SOCIALIZATION_TOOL_THREATENS_WORKPLACE_WELL-BEING)] – a custom that reflects power imbalances.

Such expectations and power dynamics, combined with intoxication, can lead to inappropriate remarks or unwanted physical contact. Indeed, another survey found **30% of workers observed vulgar talk or sexual violence frequently at drinking sessions** [[source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357030838_KOREA%27S_DRINKING_CULTURE_WHEN_AN_ORGANIZATIONAL_SOCIALIZATION_TOOL_THREATENS_WORKPLACE_WELL-BEING)].

During hoesik, the normal rules of professional etiquette are blurred. Attendees, especially juniors, feel pressure to attend and to keep drinking as a sign of loyalty. As one office worker noted, _"Hoesik is an extension of work. Skipping hoesik can leave a bad impression on your superiors"_ , indicating that **refusing to join these drinking sessions can jeopardize one's standing** [[source](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/12/10/national/socialAffairs/South-Korea-hoesik-workplace/20231210175110287.html)].

This pressure is equally present in academic settings: university faculty in Korea often invite students (such as advisees or entire classes) to hoesik-style dinners. In film and arts schools, where networking and mentor relationships are informal, it is not uncommon for professors or famous alumni to hold private drinking parties with students.

The Korea Women's Development Institute has noted that **"networks are also formed at private drinking parties, and artistic luminaries who are invited to these may cause sexual violence"** [[source](https://www.korea.kr/archive/expDocView.do?docId=39236)].

A notorious example occurred at Seoul National University, where a professor was **charged with sexual violence for groping female students during a hoesik gathering** [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoesik)].

This case underscored how the casual atmosphere of drinking parties can enable predatory behavior under the guise of "after-hours" socializing.

Notably, official data tie hoesik directly to incidences of sexual violence. The **Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in Korea** reported that workplace hoesik were the **number-one setting for sexual violence cases in both 2015 and 2018** [[source](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/12/10/national/socialAffairs/South-Korea-hoesik-workplace/20231210175110287.html)].

The ministry's triannual survey also showed a drop in sexual violence reports by 2021, which was partly attributed to fewer hoesik gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic [[source](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/12/10/national/socialAffairs/South-Korea-hoesik-workplace/20231210175110287.html)].

Alarm at such findings has prompted some institutions to take preventative measures. For instance, the Korean Navy even introduced a **"hoesik-jikimi"** system – an official supervisor who remains sober at unit hoesik to monitor and prevent sexual violence or abuse [[source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357030838_KOREA%27S_DRINKING_CULTURE_WHEN_AN_ORGANIZATIONAL_SOCIALIZATION_TOOL_THREATENS_WORKPLACE_WELL-BEING)].

In summary, Korean hoesik tradition, while intended to foster closeness, has a well-documented **dark side of elevated sexual violence risk** , especially in environments like universities or film schools where senior-junior hierarchies persist outside the office [[source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357030838_KOREA%27S_DRINKING_CULTURE_WHEN_AN_ORGANIZATIONAL_SOCIALIZATION_TOOL_THREATENS_WORKPLACE_WELL-BEING)][[source](https://www.korea.kr/archive/expDocView.do?docId=39236)].

# University Policies on Faculty–Student Drinking: A Global Comparison

## Japan

Japanese law strictly prohibits providing alcohol to **minors under 20** , and most universities discourage off-campus faculty-student drinking.

For example, **Temple University Japan Campus** states: _"Students of any age are prohibited from carrying or consuming alcohol on campus or at off-campus activities arranged by the university"_ [[source](https://www.tuj.ac.jp/ug/policies/student-conduct.html)].

In 2022, a Japanese lawmaker resigned after going drinking with an 18-year-old student [[source](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20220407/p2a/00m/0na/017000c)].

## China

**Xi'an Fanyi University** implemented a **blanket alcohol ban** in 2016, prohibiting faculty and students from drinking even off-campus during enrollment or employment [[source](https://gbtimes.com/chinese-university-bans-alcohol-consumption-by-students-and-teachers)].

This extreme example reflects China's broader trend toward **preventing faculty-student drinking** under strict conduct codes.

## United States, Canada, and Other Western Countries

There is **no blanket ban** , but strong professional boundaries are expected. Under **Title IX** , any sexual violence at off-campus events involving alcohol may result in disciplinary action.

  * **DePauw University** policy: Faculty must _"exercise good judgment"_ when socializing with students over alcohol [[source](https://www.depauw.edu/files/resources/employee-handbook-updated-2019.pdf)].

  * **University of Central Florida** suspended a professor in 2024 after **partying and drinking with students at a conference** [[source](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/03/10/ucf-professor-suspended-over-alcohol-related-incident-with-students/)].

  * In **UK** , the Office for Students issued new guidance in 2024 mandating that universities prevent **staff-student relationships involving "abuse of power"** [[source](https://www.irishnews.com/news/education/universities-face-sanctions-if-they-fail-to-address-staff-student-relationships-VYH5JAWUUBHRBFSWE77R6KZJ2E/)].

  * In **Australia** , the 2017 _Change the Course_ report found drinking cultures in residential colleges **contributed to sexual assault risk** [[source](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/aug/01/university-sexual-assault-report-live)].
