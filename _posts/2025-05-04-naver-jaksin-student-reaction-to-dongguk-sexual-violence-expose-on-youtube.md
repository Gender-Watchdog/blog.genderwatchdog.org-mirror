A revealing moment in Korea's digital public sphere: a student recently encountered our YouTube exposé on the structural sexual violence risks and falsified partnerships at Dongguk University's graduate film program. The student posted the following question on Naver 지식iN (Jaksin), Korea's largest Q&A platform:

*Screeenshot: Naver 지식iN comment expressing concern about Dongguk University's reputation after seeing the YouTube exposé (May 6, 2025)*

> "최근 유튭에 동국대 대학원 영화과 성폭력, 구조적 위험성, 그리고 외국대학이랑 허위협약 맺고 있다며 저격하는 영상올리는 채널을 우연히 봤어요. 영상들 조회수는 100회도 안되긴 하는데 괜히 기분이 안좋네요. 솔직히 동국대 훌리는 아니지만 그래도 학교자체는 만족하며 다니고 있는데(날 뽑아준 유일한 인서울대학이기도해서) 그런 영상들 보면 막 학교위상, 인식 떨어질거 같고 입결도 낮아질까봐 불안해요... 좀 오바같긴해도 제가 진짜 쓸데없는 걱정 많이 하고 살아요. 어떻게 해야 이런맘이 살아질까요"

**Translation:**
> "I recently saw a YouTube channel exposing sexual violence, structural risks, and alleged fake partnerships at Dongguk University's graduate film program. The videos have less than 100 views, but they made me feel uneasy. Honestly, I'm not a Dongguk stan, but I'm satisfied with the school (it's the only Seoul university that accepted me). When I see those videos, I worry about the school's reputation, public perception, and whether admissions will get harder... Maybe I'm overreacting, but I really worry about useless things. How can I stop feeling this way?"

The top reply, marked as the "best answer," was:

> "학교에 대한 걱정이 크신 것 같아 이해합니다. 그런 영상이 심리적으로 영향을 줄 수도 있지만, 일시적인 현상일 수 있습니다. 학교에 대한 자신감과 긍정적인 생각을 유지하고 학교를 잘 다니며 성장하는 데 집중해보세요. 우선 본인의 학업과 경험에 집중하시면 좋습니다. 응원합니다. 힘내세요!"

**Translation:**
> "I understand your concern about the school. Such videos can affect you psychologically, but it may be temporary. Maintain confidence and positive thoughts about your school, focus on your studies and growth. Concentrate on your academics and experiences. Cheering you on!"

## Analysis: Reputation Anxiety and the Culture of Silence

This exchange is a microcosm of the broader institutional and cultural dynamics that enable sexual violence to persist in Korean higher education:

- **Reputation Over Reality:** The student's first concern is not the safety of peers or the substance of the exposé, but the university's reputation and admissions competitiveness. This reflects how institutional branding and "입결" (admissions stats) are prioritized over student safety and accountability.
- **Deflection and Silence:** The top reply does not address the underlying issues of sexual violence or institutional cover-ups. Instead, it encourages the student to ignore the problem and focus on personal success—a classic example of the culture of silence and deflection that enables abuse to continue.
- **Structural Denial:** The lack of critical engagement with the exposé's content is itself a form of institutional complicity. When students are socialized to value reputation over justice, and to "just focus on your studies," real change becomes impossible.

## Why This Matters

This Naver Jaksin comment is a snapshot of why advocacy is so difficult in Korea: even when evidence is presented, the dominant response is to minimize, deflect, or worry about image rather than demand accountability. This is exactly why international scrutiny and external pressure are necessary to break the cycle of silence.
