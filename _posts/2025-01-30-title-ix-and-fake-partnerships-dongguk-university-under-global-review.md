**Dongguk University in Seoul** , long regarded as Korea's top graduate school for film, operates a Master's program in Digital Media and Contents that presents **serious structural risk factors for sexual violence** :

  * The faculty is **entirely male**
  * The program **shares its building** with commercial film entities such as **Sidus FNH**
  * In 2018, Dongguk **abolished its Women's Student Council** during the height of the MeToo movement
  * There are **no visible independent mechanisms** for reporting sexual violence



Despite these red flags, Dongguk continues to promote international exchange programs with multiple institutions worldwide — including several **Canadian and U.S. universities** — via its official website:

🔻 **Dongguk's only official response to date was** :

> "For what purpose did you send the e-mail? Is it for suggestion or reporting?"

This reply, sent by Dongguk's **Global Student Team** , was not escalated to any legal, ethics, or Title IX-equivalent office. It suggests **dismissiveness** , not diligence.

### 🎭 Broader Risks: Gender Equity & Institutional Transparency

According to research by the **Korean Women's Development Institute** , graduate programs in the arts — especially those tied to the film industry — exhibit **some of the highest rates of sexual violence in Korean higher education**.

📄 Study: ["University Students in the Culture and Arts after the MeToo Movement"](https://drive.proton.me/urls/BAPF2DA400#4RGLR08iLFAJ)

Key patterns include:

  * Structural **silencing of survivors**
  * Lack of **independent reporting systems**
  * High prevalence of **retaliation or reputational threats**
  * Power held exclusively by **male faculty** in career-determining contexts



### ❓ Open Questions for the Public and Partner Schools

  * Are international students being placed into high-risk environments under the guise of "prestige"?
  * Why do some schools appear on partner lists without active agreements?
  * What obligations do sending institutions have when host environments are structurally unsafe?
