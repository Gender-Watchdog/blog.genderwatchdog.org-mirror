## ⚖️ Why This Matters

In light of growing concerns over systemic gender bias and institutional silence surrounding harassment cases in higher education, it is essential for partner universities, grant agencies, and festival boards to ensure that collaboration aligns with internationally recognized human rights and equity standards.

These archives offer a foundation for:
- **Transparency and accountability** in cross-border educational cooperation
- **Fact-checking and media investigations**
- **Risk assessments by Title IX and EDI offices globally**

Institutions considering ongoing exchange, co-production, or research partnerships with Dongguk University may wish to reexamine the ethical implications in light of these findings.
