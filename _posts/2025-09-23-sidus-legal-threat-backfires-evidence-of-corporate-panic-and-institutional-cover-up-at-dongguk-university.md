On May 27, 2025, Sidus Corporation, represented by Law Firm Shinwon, sent an official legal threat demanding we retract our documentation of systematic sexual violence enabled by the Dongguk University–Sidus corporate partnership. This legal threat, delivered with aggressive language and a demand for a public apology, is not only an act of intimidation but also a clear sign of institutional panic and a culture of silencing sexual violence victims.

## Sidus FNH's Campus Presence: Contradictory Evidence

Sidus's legal threat claims they have had no connection to Dongguk University for over 15 years. However, Dongguk University's own official website, archived as recently as [April 8, 2025](https://web.archive.org/web/20250408005624/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#), states:

> "The department is located in the building, so-called 'Choong-Moo-Ro Yeong-Sang Center,' in which Sidus FNH, one of the top five film production companies in Korea, is based."

This directly contradicts Sidus's denial and demonstrates that their presence on campus is not a rumor but an institutional fact. [See the archived page here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20250408005624/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#)

## Timeline Contradictions and Corporate Identity Games

Sidus's legal threat claims they left Dongguk in 2009 and have had no relationship since. Yet, their own [corporate history](https://archive.md/NJy3h#selection-161.7-156.13) shows:
- 2005: Company merged and became SidusFNH
- 2015: Changed name back to Sidus (10 years ago, not 15)
- 2025: Still referenced as Sidus FNH on Dongguk's website

This timeline inconsistency raises serious questions: Is Sidus maintaining a shadow presence on campus by playing with corporate names? Are they denying their presence to avoid accountability while continuing to use their industry connections to pressure, coerce, and threaten vulnerable female students—especially after incidents of sexual violence?

## Predatory Access and the Culture of Silence

Sidus's aggressive, emotional legal threat is not the action of a company with nothing to hide. Their demands—immediate retraction, apology, and threats of criminal and civil action—are classic tactics used to silence victims and whistleblowers. This is how powerful institutions have historically gotten their way and suppressed reports of sexual violence.

It is telling that Sidus, no longer a top five film production company and facing a post-MeToo environment where students are more aware and less easily manipulated, is now panicking. Their intimidation tactics are a desperate attempt to maintain control and prevent prosecutors or police from questioning female students, which would quickly reveal boundary violations and possibly criminal conduct. The question remains: does Dongguk set any boundaries at all, or has it enabled this predatory access for years?

**September 2025 Update**: Our subsequent investigation revealed that Tcha Sung-Jai, Sidus FNH's founder and co-CEO, simultaneously held a teaching position as a "French instructor" at Dongguk University while also serving as President of the Korea Film Producers Association. This quadruple role created unprecedented systematic control over vulnerable students.

## Evidence of Institutional Cover-Up

Sidus's legal threat is not just a legal maneuver—it is evidence of a broader institutional cover-up. Their willingness to threaten, contradict public records, and demand secrecy is a red flag for investigators and advocates alike.

## Global Bar Association Complaints: Holding Law Firm Shinwon Accountable

Immediately after receiving the legal threat, we reported Law Firm Shinwon and Attorney Baek Kyung-tae to major bar associations and legal oversight bodies in Korea, across Asia, and internationally. Our complaint was sent to:
- Korean Bar Association (member@koreanbar.or.kr)
- Seoul Bar Association (webmaster@seoulbar.or.kr)
- International Bar Association (iba@int-bar.org, member@int-bar.org)
- Inter-Pacific Bar Association (ipba@ipba.org)
- LawAsia (lawasia@lawasia.asn.au)
- Bar Council UK (contactus@barcouncil.org.uk)
- American Bar Association (Service@americanbar.org)
- Singapore Law Society (lawsoc@lawsoc.org.sg)
- And other legal and professional bodies across North America, Europe, and Asia

This global reporting is a critical part of our strategy to ensure that legal intimidation and the silencing of sexual violence advocacy are met with real accountability. Law Firm Shinwon's conduct is not only professionally and ethically wrong—it is a violation of the standards expected of legal professionals worldwide. Lawyers are obligated to act with honesty, integrity, and respect for the public interest. Issuing frivolous legal threats that contradict public evidence, attempting to intimidate advocates, and enabling institutional cover-up of sexual violence are grave breaches of these duties.

By alerting bar associations and oversight bodies, we are ensuring that this misconduct is scrutinized at the highest levels and that the legal profession is held to account for its role in perpetuating or challenging cultures of silence and abuse. This is how we protect the integrity of advocacy and the rights of survivors everywhere.

### Analysis: Legal Intimidation as Evidence of Systematic Exploitation

This legal threat takes on new significance in light of our September 2025 documentation of Tcha Sung-Jai's quadruple role as Sidus CEO, Dongguk instructor, Korea Film Producers Association President, and campus facility sharer. The aggressive nature of this legal intimidation suggests Sidus understood that exposure of their systematic predatory access operation would reveal the sophisticated nature of their exploitation network.

**Why This Legal Threat Actually Validates Our Documentation:**

1. **Panic Response**: The emotional, aggressive tone suggests institutional panic rather than legitimate legal concern
2. **Timeline Contradictions**: Claims of "15 years" of no connection contradict Sidus's own corporate timeline and Dongguk's archived website
3. **Systematic Intimidation**: Threatens criminal prosecution for truthful documentation - exactly the silencing mechanism that enables systematic exploitation
4. **Industry-Wide Implications**: Sent to "dozens" of industry stakeholders, revealing Sidus's concern about industry-wide exposure of their predatory access model
