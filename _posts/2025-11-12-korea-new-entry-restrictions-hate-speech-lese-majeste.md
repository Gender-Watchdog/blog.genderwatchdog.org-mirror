**November 12, 2025**

The Korea Times recently reported that South Korea's Justice Minister Jung Sung-ho announced the government may restrict entry for foreigners who make "hateful or derogatory comments" about the country from overseas.[^1] While framed as combating hate speech, this policy more closely resembles **lèse-majesté laws**—historical statutes designed to protect national image rather than prevent genuine incitement to violence.

## I. False Equivalence: Conflating Conduct with Speech

The Korea Times article conflates genuinely disruptive criminal behavior with protected expression. It cites two cases:

1. **Johnny Somali** (American streamer) - indicted for physically disruptive behavior in a convenience store
2. **Debo-chan** (Korean YouTuber in Japan) - investigated for spreading false information about "dozens of mutilated bodies" in Korea

One involves physical disruption; the other involves speech. These require fundamentally different legal frameworks. Yet the policy treats both categories identically—and extends to any "derogatory comments" made abroad.

## II. Vagueness: The Core Problem

### Undefined Terms Create Arbitrary Enforcement

Critical terms lack legal definition:
- **"Hateful or derogatory comments"** - no statutory definition provided
- **"Sweeping negative generalizations"** - purely subjective interpretation  
- **"Derogatory"** - could encompass legitimate criticism

Consider this example: A student journalist at Chadwick International School recently published an article in Herald Insights documenting racism in South Korea using government data and expert testimony.[^2] The article noted:

> "According to these organizations, 2.5 million immigrants now live in Korea... A 2020 Segye Ilbo survey of 207 foreign residents revealed that 7 out of 10 respondents said 'Koreans discriminate based on skin color.'"[^2]

Under this new framework, would international outlets republishing this documented analysis face entry restrictions for "derogatory comments about Korea"? The policy provides no clear answer.

## III. Lèse-Majesté Disguised as Hate Speech Law

### Historical Context

**Lèse-majesté** (from Latin *laesa māiestās*, "hurt majesty") originated as treason against the Roman Emperor.[^3] Modern iterations criminalize offenses against the dignity of a head of state or nation—prioritizing institutional reputation over freedom of expression.

Contemporary examples include:
- **Thailand**: Article 112 criminalizes defaming the monarchy, with sentences of 3-15 years. From January 2006 to May 2011, over 400 cases came to trial[^3]
- **Cambodia**: 2018 law punishes insulting the monarchy with 1-5 years imprisonment[^3]
- **Poland**: Article 135 criminalizes publicly insulting the president with up to 3 years imprisonment[^3]

While many European democracies have **abolished** such laws (Belgium repealed its lèse-majesté statute in 2023; Sweden in 1948; Norway in 2015[^3]), authoritarian regimes continue expanding them—often framing restrictions as protecting national honor rather than individual dignity.

### Korea's Proposal Follows This Pattern

The Korean policy:
- Protects **national image** ("derogatory comments about Korea")
- Targets **overseas speech** (extraterritorial scope)
- Lacks **clear definitions** (enabling arbitrary enforcement)
- Applies **prospectively** (banning future entry, not prosecuting specific crimes)

This mirrors lèse-majesté frameworks—not legitimate hate speech legislation.

## IV. Legitimate Hate Speech Laws vs. Reputation Protection

### Advanced Jurisdictions Define Hate Speech Narrowly

Germany's approach illustrates the distinction. Despite strict hate speech prohibitions, German law:
- Defines **Volksverhetzung** (incitement of hatred) with specific criteria focused on **incitement to violence**[^4]
- Protects institutional criticism as **core free speech**
- Prohibits Nazi symbols and Holocaust denial—but based on historical atrocities, not national reputation
- Does **not** ban criticism of German government policies

Even Germany's controversial 2017 Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG), criticized for encouraging over-censorship, targets **illegal content** under existing law—not "derogatory" comments about the nation.[^4]

Korea's proposal inverts this: it prioritizes **national reputation** over incitement standards, mirroring authoritarian approaches rather than democratic norms.

## V. Extraterritorial Jurisdiction: A Global Overreach

The policy targets content created "from overseas"—claiming authority to:
1. **Monitor global social media** for criticism of Korea
2. **Punish speech** made outside Korean territory  
3. **Restrict future entry** based on protected speech in the creator's home country

This raises serious international law concerns. Extraterritorial jurisdiction typically applies to:
- **Universal crimes** (genocide, war crimes, terrorism)
- **Conduct affecting domestic territory** (cybercrime targeting local victims)
- **Citizens' actions abroad** (child sexual abuse by nationals overseas)[^5]

**Protected speech criticizing a foreign government does not fall into these categories.** France's Foreign Ministry condemned similar U.S. extraterritorial sanctions as "illegal under international law" in 2017.[^5]

## VI. The Paradox: Simultaneous Expansion and Reform

### President Lee's Contradictory Proposals

On November 11, 2025, President Lee Jae Myung announced **two simultaneous reforms** that appear contradictory on their face:[^9]

1. **Expand criminal penalties** for hate speech targeting domestic rallies and protests
2. **Abolish criminal defamation** for factual statements (making it civil-only)

Lee stated explicitly:
> "If we do amend the Criminal Act, we should take the opportunity to review abolishing the crime of defamation by factual statement. If defamation does occur through factual statements, it should be a civil case. It shouldn't be a criminal offense."[^9]

This creates profound tension: the government simultaneously proposes to **criminalize** certain speech (hate speech at rallies) while **decriminalizing** other speech (factual statements currently prosecutable as defamation).

### Why This Reform Could Be Progressive—If Implemented Fairly

**The defamation reform would benefit accountability advocates:**

Currently, South Korea's criminal defamation law enables powerful perpetrators to threaten institutional critics and survivors with **imprisonment** for truthful testimony. If defamation becomes civil-only:
- Advocates documenting institutional sexual violence (like corporate executives holding academic positions) couldn't be threatened with criminal prosecution—only civil damages
- Survivors facing retaliation from powerful figures (entertainment corporations, academic institutions) would face reduced threat of imprisonment
- International students reporting harassment by faculty or administrators would face lower barriers to speaking out

**This is a significant human rights improvement.**

Note: YouTuber Kwak Hyeol-su's November 2025 testimony about rape by a taxi driver occurred after the driver was already indicted in September 2025,[^10] meaning she faced minimal legal retaliation risk (taxi drivers typically lack resources for defamation suits). The reform would most benefit survivors facing retaliation from **powerful perpetrators** with legal resources—precisely the pattern this advocacy documents at Korean universities and entertainment companies.

### The Critical Caveat: Selective Enforcement Risk

However, civic groups immediately identified the flaw. Park Dong-chan of the Third Voice Institute noted:
> "There are movements to enact legislation that would ban hate speech, but I don't understand why legislators are pushing the band-aid of hate speech laws when the fundamental measure of an anti-discrimination law is already on the table."[^9]

Activist Mong, co-chair of the Coalition for Anti-discrimination Legislation, emphasized:
> "Before enacting legislation that specifically deals with hate speech, we need to lay the groundwork with an anti-discrimination law. Anti-hate speech laws won't do anything without an anti-discrimination law."[^9]

**Without foundational anti-discrimination law, hate speech legislation risks becoming another tool for selective enforcement—protecting institutions rather than vulnerable populations.**

## VII. Selective Enforcement: Who Gets Silenced?

### Pattern of Asymmetric Accountability

The divergence between Justice Minister Jung's travel ban proposal (Korea Times, Nov 12)[^1] and President Lee's defamation reform (Hankyoreh, Nov 12)[^9] reveals competing visions within Korean government:

**Justice Ministry approach:** Restrict entry for foreign "derogatory comments"
**Presidential approach:** Decriminalize truthful defamation + criminalize domestic hate speech rallies

Yet **neither addresses the core problem**: lack of comprehensive anti-discrimination law.

The Korea Times article mentions prosecutions of foreign critics but is notably silent on:
- **Korean content creators** spreading disinformation about foreigners
- **SNL Korea** mocking Hanni (NewJeans member) after her harassment testimony[^6]
- **Anti-Chinese/foreigner rallies** in Seoul that prompted Lee's hate speech crackdown[^9]

This selective focus mirrors broader systemic issues in Korean legal frameworks that protect institutions over individuals.

### Korea's Current Speech Restrictions

The reforms emerge within a legal environment that already restricts accountability:

1. **Criminal defamation law** that punishes **truthful statements**[^7] (Lee proposes abolishing this)
2. **Non-consent-based rape law** (rejected reform in 2023)[^8] enabling defamation countersuits against victims
3. **Institutional impunity** for documented abuses
4. **Proposed travel bans** for foreign critics making "derogatory comments"[^1]

As Human Rights Watch noted regarding South Korea's rape law: 
> "Consent should be at the heart of any legal definition of rape. Article 297 of South Korea's penal code defines rape as intercourse by means of 'violence or intimidation'... insufficient for 'violence or intimidation' to be present, but rather it should render the victim unable to resist."[^8]

This creates **asymmetric accountability**: 
- Foreign critics face travel bans for "derogatory comments"
- Domestic hate speech rallies now face criminal penalties
- But truthful defamation might be decriminalized
- Yet institutional sexual violence remains unpunished

## VIII. Timing Reveals Defensive Posture

The competing policy announcements (Justice Ministry travel bans + Presidential hate speech/defamation reforms) emerged simultaneously on November 11-12, 2025, coinciding with:

- **216+ days** of government silence on documented institutional sexual violence[^6]
- **International universities** reviewing Korean partnerships
- **Chinese student testimonies** about sexual harassment going viral on Xiaohongshu (predicted drop in applications from China materialized with Vietnam taking top spot)[^6]
- Growing **global scrutiny** of systemic issues
- **Sinophobic rallies** in Seoul prompting Lee's September 9 crackdown orders[^9]

President Lee explicitly cited these rallies as motivation:
> "That's not freedom of speech. That's just rabble-rousing," he said at the September Cabinet meeting, calling for aggressive responses to rallies that "fan hatred."[^9]

Yet the Justice Ministry's travel ban proposal targets **foreign critics abroad**—not domestic hate speech rallies. This divergence suggests **conflicting priorities** within Korean government agencies.

## IX. The NewJeans Connection: Systemic Silencing

The same legal framework enables:
- **Courts forcing NewJeans back to ADOR** despite it being "like telling a bullying victim to return to the same school"[^6]
- **SNL Korea mocking Hanni** for harassment testimony amid anti-foreigner sentiment[^6]  
- **80% of K-pop trainees** suffering amenorrhea (medical harm)[^6] without accountability
- **Foreign critics** facing entry restrictions for documenting these patterns

The through-line: **institutions protected, individuals silenced.**

## X. Conclusion: Competing Visions, Fundamental Gaps

Korea now faces three simultaneous, contradictory speech policy proposals:

1. **Justice Ministry:** Travel bans for foreigners making "derogatory comments" abroad[^1]
2. **President Lee:** Criminal penalties for domestic hate speech rallies[^9]
3. **President Lee:** Abolish criminal defamation for truthful statements[^9]

### The Progressive Reform (Defamation Decriminalization)

Lee's proposal to decriminalize defamation based on factual statements represents **genuine human rights progress**—aligning with international standards that protect accountability journalism and survivor testimony. This would benefit:
- Sexual violence survivors facing retaliation from powerful perpetrators
- Institutional accountability advocates documenting predatory appointments
- International students reporting harassment by faculty or administrators

**This reform deserves support.**

### The Authoritarian Overreach (Travel Bans)

Yet the Justice Ministry's travel ban proposal remains **modern lèse-majesté**—targeting overseas criticism with undefined "derogatory comments" standards. The 11th-grade journalist's article in Herald Insights demonstrates the absurdity: citing government statistics about racism (68% of immigrants report discrimination; 70% of foreign residents say "Koreans discriminate based on skin color")[^2] could constitute grounds for entry restrictions.

### The Missing Foundation (Anti-Discrimination Law)

Korean civic groups identified the core problem: **without comprehensive anti-discrimination law, selective enforcement risks remain**. As activists emphasized, hate speech laws become "band-aids" when foundational protections don't exist.[^9]

This creates dangerous possibilities:
- Truthful defamation decriminalized (good)
- But travel bans silence foreign critics (bad)
- Domestic hate speech criminalized (good if fairly enforced)
- But no anti-discrimination law prevents selective targeting (bad)

### The Pattern Persists

Advanced democracies are **abolishing** lèse-majesté protections (Belgium 2023, Netherlands 2020, Germany 2017[^3]), recognizing they undermine democratic discourse. Korea proposes expanding state power to silence overseas criticism—while simultaneously taking progressive steps on domestic speech reform.

**The contradiction reveals the fundamental issue: institutional reputation prioritized over individual rights.**

As the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression has emphasized, restrictions on expression must meet strict tests of **necessity and proportionality**. Protecting national reputation from foreign "derogatory comments" does not qualify—regardless of how progressive domestic reforms may be.
