## Open Letter to the Faculty of Buddhism at Dongguk University

* * *

**Dear Professors of the Faculty of Buddhism at Dongguk University,**

I hope this message finds you in good health and reflective spirit.

As scholars of Dharma and stewards of Buddhist philosophy in Korea, your teachings guide not only the personal development of your students but also the ethical atmosphere of the university. Dongguk's founding identity as a Buddhist institution confers upon you a unique responsibility to uphold the principles of _non-harming_ , _compassion_ , _right speech_ , and _right action_ â€” both within your classrooms and in institutional structures.

We therefore write to express deep concern over Dongguk University's widespread **gender imbalance in faculty composition** , most urgently in the **Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents** , where all professors are male  
(as documented on your official site:  
ðŸ‘‰ <https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#>).

This is not a trivial matter of statistics, but a serious structural risk that would violate Title IX protections in U.S. partner institutions. As you are aware:

  * Power dynamics between male professors and female students can easily become hierarchical, coercive, and create environments where sexual violence can occur.
  * The digital contents program places students in direct proximity to Korea's entertainment industry, notably **Sidus FNH** , without adequate protections against sexual assault or gender representation.
  * The absence of any female academic presence removes a critical channel for student advocacy, reporting of sexual violence, and ethical accountability.



From both a Buddhist ethical perspective and the legal framework established by Title IX in the United States, this raises serious contradictions.

> How can a university grounded in the Eightfold Path and bodhisattva precepts â€” especially the commitment to relieve suffering â€” fail to address an institutional environment where female students are at heightened risk of sexual violence, sexual assault, and professional coercion? These are precisely the conditions that Title IX was designed to prevent in educational settings.

We ask, with sincere respect:

  * How does your department interpret its silence or inaction in light of both core Buddhist values and the standards embodied in Title IX legislation aimed at protecting students from sexual violence?
  * Are there internal discussions among the Buddhist Studies faculty regarding the contradiction between Dongguk's founding philosophy, international legal standards for preventing sexual violence in education, and its current faculty structure?
  * Will your department, in its role as the moral center of the university, support or initiate reforms across the campus that would align with both Buddhist ethics and Title IX-equivalent protections against sexual abuse and violence?



We ask these questions **not in opposition** , but in alignment with your deeper ethical mission and the legal standards that govern many of Dongguk's international partnerships.

This message is being shared with the Office of International Affairs and other departments to begin a **university-wide dialogue** rooted in Buddhist values of _compassion_ , _courage_ , and _justice_ , as well as internationally recognized legal frameworks for preventing sexual violence in education.
