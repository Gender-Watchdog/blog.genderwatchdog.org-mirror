## Structural Vulnerabilities of International Students in Korean Universities

International students studying in South Korea face a complex web of vulnerabilities that extend beyond the normal challenges of studying abroad. A disturbing pattern emerges when examining how structural racism, cultural hierarchies, and institutional failures create environments where foreign students—particularly women—face heightened risks of sexual violence with limited pathways for protection or justice.

### Visa Status and Power Imbalance

Perhaps the most fundamental vulnerability stems from visa dependency. International students' legal right to remain in Korea is tied directly to their continued enrollment. This creates an extreme power imbalance where:

- Students fear academic retaliation if they report misconduct
- The significant financial investment already made in tuition and relocation creates pressure to endure unsafe situations
- Options to transfer to other Korean institutions are limited, especially in specialized programs like film studies

### Language and Cultural Barriers to Reporting

Even when students want to report sexual violence, substantial barriers exist:

- Limited Korean language fluency makes official reporting mechanisms effectively inaccessible
- Unfamiliarity with Korean legal protections and reporting procedures
- Cultural differences in recognizing and responding to inappropriate behavior
- No standardized support services with English or other language capabilities

As [documented by Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/video/news/20220114/raped-assaulted-nowhere-to-find-help-foreign-women-speak-out-about-their-experiences-of-sexual-violence-in-korea), foreign women who experience sexual violence in Korea often find themselves in a devastating position: traumatized and with nowhere to turn for help. The article details how "foreign women speak out about their experiences of sexual violence in Korea" but face institutional indifference or outright discrimination.

### Social Isolation as a Risk Factor

International students typically lack the social protection networks that might otherwise serve as safeguards:

- Absence of family connections or long-standing friendships
- Limited integration with Korean student communities
- Fewer trusted mentors to advise them when issues arise
- Isolation from embassy services, especially for students from smaller countries with limited diplomatic presence

## Racial Dynamics and Sexual Violence Risk

### Fetishization of Foreign Students

A particularly troubling aspect is the racial fetishization that occurs within certain Korean contexts:

- The term "백마" (baekma, "white horse") reflects the fetishization of white women
- Chinese and Southeast Asian women face different but equally problematic stereotyping
- These fetishizing narratives portray foreign women as simultaneously exotic and more sexually available
- Media representations reinforce these harmful stereotypes

### Nationalistic Attitudes and Othering

South Korea's strong national identity can sometimes manifest in ways that further marginalize international students:

- Rising anti-Chinese sentiment amplified by recent political tensions
- Hierarchy of perceived national status where Western students may receive preferential treatment over other Asian students
- Unresolved historical issues with countries like Vietnam create additional layers of prejudice
- The "han" (한) cultural concept of enduring suffering can normalize mistreatment

## Institutional Failures and Blind Spots

### University Recruitment vs. Protection

Many Korean universities aggressively recruit international students without creating adequate support systems:

- Focus on enrollment numbers over student well-being
- Marketing materials highlighting "international experience" without addressing safety concerns
- Limited cross-cultural training for faculty and staff
- Few international faculty members who might serve as advocates

### Documentation Challenges

When incidents do occur, international students face additional hurdles in documenting and pursuing cases:

- Difficulty preserving evidence across language barriers
- Challenges navigating Korean legal and administrative systems as foreigners
- Fear that complaints could affect immigration status or future employment
- Cultural emphasis on "saving face" discouraging public complaints

## Case Studies and Patterns

The case of Dongguk University's graduate film program illustrates many of these vulnerabilities:

- All-male faculty creates power dynamics where female international students have no potential advocates
- Shared campus space with commercial film entities (e.g., Sidus FNH) blurs boundaries between academic supervision and industry exploitation
- Absence of an independent reporting system for sexual violence
- Documented pattern of institutional delay in responding to sexual violence (taking 9 months to implement even token policy changes after a 2015 assault)

## Creating Safer Environments: A Path Forward

Addressing these intersecting vulnerabilities requires coordinated effort:

1. **Independent Reporting Mechanisms**
   - Multi-language reporting systems
   - Third-party advocates not tied to academic evaluation
   - Clear pathways to support that don't jeopardize visa status

2. **Cultural and Structural Changes**
   - Gender balance in faculty, especially in high-risk programs
   - Training on power dynamics and cultural differences
   - Zero tolerance for fetishizing or racist language/behavior

3. **International Standards Compliance**
   - Title IX-equivalent protections for international students
   - Transparent public data on sexual violence incidents and responses
   - Regular external auditing of university safety measures

## Conclusion

The intersections of racial dynamics, cultural barriers, and institutional failures create environments where international students face disproportionate risks of sexual violence with minimal protection. As Korean universities continue their push to attract more international students (with goals of 300,000 foreign students by 2027), addressing these systemic vulnerabilities must become a priority.

Institutions that fail to implement comprehensive protections not only endanger their students but also risk severe reputational damage internationally. Without meaningful reform, international partnerships—particularly with institutions bound by Title IX compliance—will inevitably dissolve, threatening Korea's ambitions to become a global education hub.
