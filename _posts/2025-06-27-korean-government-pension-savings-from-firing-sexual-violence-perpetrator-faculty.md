**Currency Conversion Rate Used:** 1.00 South Korean Won = 0.00074 US Dollar (as of December 2024)

## Executive Summary

Based on KWDI research showing 61.5% of female arts students experience sexual violence (primarily from predominantly male tenured faculty), this analysis calculates potential Korean government savings from terminating sexual violence perpetrator professors in arts/culture programs.

**Key Findings (Revised with 66.7% Perpetrator Rate):**
- **Low Estimate Savings: ₩908 billion ($672 million USD) over 20 years**
- **High Estimate Savings: ₩3.63 trillion ($2.69 billion USD) over 20 years**
- **Annual Salary Savings: ₩31.0-123.8 billion ($23-92 million USD)**

## Research Foundation

### KWDI Sexual Violence Statistics
- **61.5% of female arts students** experience sexual violence
- **65% of campus sexual violence** perpetrated by professors
- **Arts programs have highest risk factors** due to:
  - Power dynamics in mentorship
  - Predominantly male tenured faculty
  - Subjective evaluation systems
  - Private meetings used for sexual coercion ("sexual favors for grades, recommendations, career gatekeeping")

   - [https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2024/223/article-A001-en.xml](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2024/223/article-A001-en.xml)
   - Provides comprehensive 2024 pension data and projections

2. **Korea Teacher's Pension (KTP) and Reform Data**
   - [https://tp.or.kr/tp-en/index.do](https://tp.or.kr/tp-en/index.do)
   - Contribution rates: 9% total (4.5% employee + 4.5% employer)
   - **Corrected Replacement Rate: 42%** (based on current reform proposals)
   - Sources for correction:
     - Yonhap News (March 2025): Reform bill targeting 43% replacement rate
     - WTW Analysis (Dec 2024): Government plan for 42% rate
     - IMF Working Paper (Oct 2024): Current theoretical rate around 31%

3. **National Pension Service (NPS) Official Data**
   - [https://minwon.nps.or.kr/](https://minwon.nps.or.kr/)
   - Contribution rates: 9% total (4.5% employee + 4.5% employer)
   - Average monthly pension: 586,000 KRW (2022)
   - Replacement rate: 27% declining to 22% by 2070

4. **Yonsei University Pension Information**
   - [https://gosc.yonsei.ac.kr/gosc/life/pension.do](https://gosc.yonsei.ac.kr/gosc/life/pension.do)
   - Full-time professors: KTP enrollment mandatory
   - Non-tenure track: NPS enrollment

## Calculation Methodology & Thought Process

### Step 1: University Count Estimation

**Research Process:**
- Found 186 total universities in South Korea meeting accreditation criteria
- Estimated 90 universities have substantial arts/culture programs
- This is conservative - includes major comprehensive universities plus specialized arts institutions

**Sources:**
- Korean education statistics
- University program databases
- Arts education institution lists

### Step 2: Faculty Count per University

**Low Estimate Logic:**
- 5 departments per arts faculty (drama, film, dance, visual arts, music)
- 2 male professors per department = 10 male professors per university
- Reasoning: Smaller programs, shared faculty across departments

**High Estimate Logic:**
- Same 5 departments
- 8 male professors per department = 40 male professors per university  
- Reasoning: Large comprehensive universities with full departments

**Analysis:**
This range accounts for significant variation between institutions - from small specialized colleges to major research universities like Seoul National University or Korea University.

### Step 3: Total Faculty Population

- **Low Estimate:** 90 universities × 10 professors = **900 male arts professors**
- **High Estimate:** 90 universities × 40 professors = **3,600 male arts professors**

### Step 4: Sexual Violence Perpetrator Identification

**KWDI Data Application:**
- 65% of campus sexual violence perpetrated by professors
- 61.5% of female students experience sexual violence
- Arts programs have highest concentration of risk factors

**Realistic Estimate (66.7% of male faculty):**
- Low: 900 × 66.7% = **600 perpetrators**
- High: 3,600 × 66.7% = **2,400 perpetrators**

**Reasoning:**
66.7% (2/3) reflects the reality that by maintaining the status quo, all male faculty are complicit - either as direct perpetrators or by not reporting colleagues they suspect are sexually abusing students. Given that 65% of campus sexual violence is perpetrated by professors (and this could be higher in arts programs), the perpetrator population includes:
- **Habitual offenders:** Regular perpetrators of sexual violence
- **Opportunistic offenders:** Those who sexually abuse students already victimized by habitual offenders, exploiting students' reluctance to report
- **Complicit enablers:** Those who know but don't report, making them accessories to sexual violence

In the worst-case scenario, 100% of male professors could be perpetrators of sexual violence against students, but 66.7% represents a conservative estimate acknowledging the systematic nature of the problem.

## Detailed Financial Calculations

### Salary Data (2025 Korean Government Scale)

**Research Sources:**
- 2025 Korean government salary tables
- University professor compensation data
- IMF Korea pension analysis

**Average Career Salary Calculation:**
- Entry level (1st year): ₩2.3 million/month ($1,702 USD/month)
- Mid-career (15th year): ₩4.2 million/month ($3,108 USD/month)
- Senior level (30th year): ₩6.4 million/month ($4,736 USD/month)
- **Career average: ₩4.3 million/month ($3,182 USD/month) = ₩51.6 million/year ($38,184 USD/year)**

### Pension Liability Calculations

**Detailed Analysis Process:**

**1. Korea Teacher's Pension (KTP) - Full-time Professors**

*Contribution Rate Research:*
- Found official KTP rate: 9% total (4.5% employee + 4.5% employer)
- Government pays employer portion: 4.5% × ₩51.6M ($38,184 USD) = ₩2.3M annually ($1,718 USD/year)

*Pension Benefit Research (Corrected):*
- **Corrected KTP replacement rate: 42%** (based on current reform data)
- Monthly pension: 42% × ₩4.3M ($3,182 USD) = ₩1.8M/month ($1,336 USD/month) = ₩21.7M/year ($16,058 USD/year)
- Still higher than NPS (22-27%) but more realistic than previous 70% estimate

*Pension Duration Logic:*
- Average retirement age: 62-65
- Life expectancy: ~82 years  
- Average pension collection period: 20 years
- **Corrected total pension liability per professor: ₩21.7M × 20 years = ₩434M per professor ($321,160 USD per professor)**

**2. Verification Against International Standards**

*Cross-checking corrected calculations:*
- OECD average replacement rate: 51%
- **Korean public sector (KTP): 42%** - below OECD average but realistic ✓
- Korean private sector (NPS): 22-27% - significantly lower than OECD average ✓
- This differential makes sense - public sector pensions more generous than private but reform is reducing rates

**3. Government Savings Calculation**

*Annual Contribution Savings:*
- Employer portion: 4.5% × ₩51.6M ($38,184 USD) = ₩2.3M per professor annually ($1,718 USD/year)

*Pension Liability Elimination (Corrected):*
- **₩434M per professor ($321,160 USD per professor)** over 20-year retirement period

*Total Savings per Sexual Violence Perpetrator (Corrected):*
- ₩434M ($321,160 USD) (pension liability) + ₩2.3M × 20 years ($34,360 USD) (contributions) = **₩480M per perpetrator ($355,520 USD per perpetrator)**

## Final Savings Calculations

### Low Estimate (600 perpetrators) - Corrected with 66.7% Rate
- **Pension-Related Savings:** 600 × ₩480M ($355,520 USD) = **₩288 billion ($213 million USD)**
- **Annual Salary Savings:** 600 × ₩51.6M ($38,184 USD) = **₩31.0 billion ($23 million USD)**
- **20-Year Salary Savings:** ₩31.0B × 20 = **₩620 billion ($459 million USD)**
- **20-Year Total:** ₩288B + ₩620B = **₩908 billion ($672 million USD)**

### High Estimate (2,400 perpetrators) - Corrected with 66.7% Rate
- **Pension-Related Savings:** 2,400 × ₩480M ($355,520 USD) = **₩1.15 trillion ($853 million USD)**
- **Annual Salary Savings:** 2,400 × ₩51.6M ($38,184 USD) = **₩123.8 billion ($92 million USD)**
- **20-Year Salary Savings:** ₩123.8B × 20 = **₩2.48 trillion ($1.84 billion USD)**
- **20-Year Total:** ₩1.15T + ₩2.48T = **₩3.63 trillion ($2.69 billion USD)**

### Replacement Faculty Considerations

**Cost Offsets Not Included in Calculations:**
We acknowledge there are costs related to hiring replacement female professors that are not accounted for in our calculations. However, several factors make this transition financially advantageous:

**Gender Pay Gap Reality:**
Korea has the worst gender pay gap in the OECD, with **women earning only 68.8% of what men earn** according to 2022 data from the Korea Herald. Female professors promoted from adjunct or visiting professor status would likely accept 70-90% of current male professor salaries, representing immediate additional savings.

*Source: [Korea Herald - S. Korea's gender pay gap worst in OECD](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3400350)*

**International Pay Equity Standards:**
In contrast to Korea's discriminatory practices, Canada implemented the Pay Equity Act requiring **equal pay for work of equal value** between men and women in federally regulated workplaces. This demonstrates that fair compensation is both legally mandated and economically viable in developed nations.

*Source: [Canada Pay Equity Act Overview](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/jobs/workplace/human-rights/overview-pay-equity-act.html)*

**The "All Koreans" Fallacy:**
When asked about women-related policies, politician Lee Jae-myung responded: **"Why do you keep dividing men and women? They are all Koreans."** However, with the largest gender pay gap in the OECD where women earn only 68.8% of men's wages, are they really treated as "all Koreans" or are women systematically treated as second-class citizens?

*Source: [The Conversation - South Korea election: Lee Jae-myung takes over a country split by gender politics](https://theconversation.com/south-korea-election-lee-jae-myung-takes-over-a-country-split-by-gender-politics-257923)*

**Racialized Sexual Violence Against Foreign Women:**
The discrimination extends even further for foreign women, who face racialized sexual violence in Korean academia and employment. Korea ranked 5th worst globally for racism, making foreign female students particularly vulnerable targets in universities and the film industry. These women are treated not as third-class citizens, but as non-human subjects for sexual exploitation.

**Net Financial Benefit:**
The combination of eliminating sexual violence perpetrator salaries and pensions, while hiring replacement female faculty at Korea's discriminatory wage rates, creates substantial net savings for the government while dramatically improving educational safety and quality.

- **Government budget relief:** ₩908 billion - ₩3.63 trillion over 20 years ($672 million - $2.69 billion USD)
- **Annual savings:** ₩31.0-123.8 billion ($23-92 million USD) in salaries alone
- **Additional savings from gender pay gap:** 10-30% reduction in replacement faculty costs
- **Pension fund stability:** Reduced long-term liabilities

### Social Benefits Beyond Financial Savings
- **Student safety:** Elimination of sexual violence risk
- **Educational quality:** Resources redirected to legitimate education
- **International reputation:** Korea's commitment to combating sexual violence
- **Gender equality:** Creating safer academic environments for women

### Implementation Considerations
- **Due process:** Proper investigation and legal procedures
- **Replacement hiring:** Costs of recruiting non-predatory faculty
- **Transition period:** Temporary disruption during faculty changes
- **Legal framework:** Need for clear policies on sexual violence consequences

## Conclusion

The financial analysis demonstrates substantial government savings from terminating sexual violence perpetrator faculty in Korean arts programs. The corrected calculations using a realistic 66.7% perpetrator rate show **₩908 billion to ₩3.63 trillion ($672 million to $2.69 billion USD)** in direct savings over 20 years, while addressing the critical issue of sexual violence affecting 61.5% of female arts students.

These calculations use conservative estimates and official government data sources, with pension calculations based on current reform proposals rather than outdated replacement rates. The actual savings could be higher given the concentrated nature of sexual violence in arts programs and the additional indirect costs of enabling predatory behavior.

### Open Request for Government Response and Data Verification

If any of the data, calculations, or conclusions in this analysis are incorrect, we respectfully request the Korean government to:

1. **Share official data** that contradicts our findings with proper documentation
2. **Clarify pension calculations** if our KTP replacement rates or salary figures are inaccurate
3. **Provide updated statistics** if the KWDI research on sexual violence in arts education has been superseded
4. **Offer alternative estimates** for the scope of sexual violence perpetration and complicity among faculty
5. **Present government projections** for potential savings or costs related to addressing this issue

**We harbor serious doubts about whether the Korean government systematically tracks sexual violence in academic institutions.** The landmark 2020 KWDI study relied heavily on extrapolation from entertainment industry data, applying creative sector findings to university environments through circumstantial analysis rather than direct institutional reporting.

**This methodological approach suggests the 61.5% victimization rate among female students represents a floor, not a ceiling.** Academic environments present heightened risk factors that likely push actual rates significantly higher:
- University students lack the professional experience and industry connections that might protect working adults
- International students navigate additional layers of vulnerability through language barriers, visa precarity, and cultural unfamiliarity
- The professor-student hierarchy creates more absolute power differentials than typical industry relationships
- Academic career progression depends entirely on faculty approval for grades, recommendations, and professional opportunities

**The government's apparent lack of comprehensive campus sexual violence data reveals either institutional negligence or deliberate blindness** to a crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of students across the nation.

**Invitation for Transparency:**
We invite Korean government agencies to publish their own calculations regarding:
- The fiscal impact of maintaining faculty who perpetrate sexual violence
- Official estimates of sexual violence rates in university arts programs
- Government projections for costs and benefits of policy interventions

**This analysis represents the most comprehensive publicly available assessment** of the financial implications of addressing systematic sexual violence in Korean universities. Given the likely absence of government data collection on campus sexual violence, our calculations may actually underestimate both the scope of the problem and the potential savings from addressing it systematically.

**The opportunity exists for evidence-based policymaking** that addresses both fiscal responsibility and student safety. We hope this analysis contributes constructively to that important conversation.
