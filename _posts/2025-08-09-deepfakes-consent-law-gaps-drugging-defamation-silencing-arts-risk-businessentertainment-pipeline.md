The Hankyoreh reports that deepfake Telegram channels have targeted “70 colleges and universities across the country.” This directly overlaps with the exact same university galleries where our DC Inside advocacy has reached over 20,000 views. The implication is clear: the same students and campuses are being targeted through multiple vectors — digital sexual exploitation, online harassment, and institutional systems that already fail to protect survivors of racialized sexual violence.

> “Even now, countless victims are no doubt nervously awaiting the results of the police investigation. They’ve probably heard time and time again from friends and family members that Telegram investigations go nowhere and that they should just get over it and move on with their lives.” — [Hankyoreh: Deepfake Telegram channels target 70 universities; victims fear investigations go nowhere](https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/1157369.html)

This is precisely the environment our work has documented: institutional tolerance for digital sex crimes, weaponized legal frameworks that criminalize truthful survivor testimony, and a social media ecosystem that incubates exploitation — all converging on the same campuses.


## What the overlap shows

- The same universities: Telegram deepfake networks and DC Inside university galleries map onto each other. Our posts were seen in the very spaces where students are now being digitally targeted.
- A multi-vector system: exploitation is happening via deepfake production, platform amplification, and campus-level normalization — not isolated incidents.
- Institutional impunity: survivors anticipate non-action because investigations “go nowhere,” aligning with our findings on systematic non-enforcement and cover-ups.

[Arizona State University professor Kim Hee-won](https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/english_editorials/1210450.html) warns that far-right violence targets “women, queer people, transgender people, refugees, migrants, and people of Chinese extraction.” This isn’t hypothetical. It is already here in Korea as part of institutionalized practices that enable racialized sexual violence under the cover of entertainment, education, and defamation law.

## The documented context of harm

- 61.5% sexual violence rate in arts programs (Korean government data). Film-related departments score among the highest risk. See our statistical analysis and methodology on [Sexual Violence in ARts Education After Me Too](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/sexual-violence-in-arts-education-after-me-too-current-status-and-policy-issues/).
- Zero foreign nationals in Korean entertainment leadership after two decades of recruiting international students — a mathematical impossibility without systematic exclusion. This exclusion protects criminal operations by preventing international oversight and testimony.
- Weaponized defamation laws criminalize truthful survivor speech and accountability reporting. Major human rights groups have called for reform: [Human Rights Watch assessment](https://www.hrw.org/ja/news/2025/06/24/south-korea-human-rights-issues-for-new-government) highlights “structural discrimination against women,” the need to combat “digital sex crimes,” and to ensure laws related to defamation are not abused to suppress speech.
- International compliance pressure is building: the Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA) receives our regular updates; End Rape on Campus provides advocacy support. Multiple universities are reviewing or suspending partnerships.

## A system that connects platforms, campuses, and law

The overlap between Telegram deepfake targeting and DC Inside university galleries is not coincidence — it reveals a single system:

1. Hallyu-driven recruitment funnels foreign women into arts and entertainment programs with false promises of safety and opportunity.
2. Campus dynamics enable exploitation through coercive dependencies (grades, visas, equipment access, internships), creating conditions for sexual violence.
3. Digital ecosystems: Telegram is used for deepfake production and distribution; filmmakers.co.kr and DC Inside’s Commercial Film Gallery heavily censor exposes on sexual violence in film academia and the film industry, while the same content remains visible on university galleries. See: [Tactical Censorship: Korean Film Industry's Strategic Information Control Revealed](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/tactical-censorship-film-industrys-strategic-information-control-revealed/).
4. Legal frameworks criminalize survivor speech, deterring reporting and enabling repeat victimization.

We have further documented systematic platform suppression when advocacy threatens these arrangements — including coordinated deletion of LGBT military human rights content across DC Inside galleries, and targeted industry‑space censorship on filmmakers.co.kr and DC Inside’s Commercial Film Gallery. See our analyses: [Korean government systematic censorship of LGBT military content](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/korean-government-systematic-censorship-of-lgbt-military-content-evidence-of-institutional-suppression/) and [Tactical Censorship: Korean Film Industry's Strategic Information Control Revealed](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/tactical-censorship-film-industrys-strategic-information-control-revealed/).

## Why this matters under Korea’s current laws and trends

- Consent isn’t the legal standard: Under current law and practice, rape is defined around “violence or intimidation,” not lack of consent. A 2023 reform proposal to adopt consent-based standards was rejected by the Justice Ministry.

Broader prescription misuse and online distribution have surged; an April–August analysis found 72.8% of online drug sales occurred via Telegram.

- Defamation law silences survivors: Truthful testimony can trigger defamation liability, enabling institutions to suppress reporting — a pattern flagged by human rights groups and experienced directly in our work. See HRW’s 2025 assessment and our documentation of legal intimidation: [HRW assessment](https://www.hrw.org/ja/news/2025/06/24/south-korea-human-rights-issues-for-new-government) | [Our legal‑threat analysis](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/sidus-legal-threat-backfires-evidence-of-corporate-panic-and-institutional-cover-up-at-dongguk-university/).
- High campus risk baseline: Korean government data show a 61.5% sexual violence rate in arts programs — with film among the highest risk. Foreign students face additional vulnerabilities tied to immigration status, language, and industry “gatekeeping.” Source: [Our statistical analysis](https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/counting-the-invisible-female-international-students-and-sexual-violence-in-korean-arts-programs-2008-2025/).

Together, these factors — non‑consent‑based rape law, proliferating date‑rape drugs, racialized unequal protection for foreigners, defamation‑based silencing, and high‑risk arts faculties — function as a tightly coupled, institutionalized trafficking system. It is an exploitation architecture sustained by an illegal sex economy long estimated at roughly 4% of GDP and reinforced by legal frameworks that punish victims and protect perpetrators, and by a quid pro quo “business entertainment” pipeline in which sexual services are used to secure contracts and relationships.

Quid pro quo system evidence:
- Normalized expectation of sexual entertainment in corporate relationship‑building
- Corporate slush funds financing prostitution framed as business expenses
- Grooming via “legitimate” internships and networking that funnel vulnerable students into sexual exploitation

## What needs to happen now

- Universities must immediately warn their students, provide trauma-informed reporting channels, and suspend partnerships with entities implicated in digital sexual exploitation.
- Platforms must prioritize survivor safety: enforce anti-deepfake policies, preserve evidence, and provide transparent cooperation with independent investigators and civil society.
- International partners — universities, festivals, streamers, and investors — should condition relationships on concrete reforms, including abolition of defamation-based criminalization of truthful survivor testimony.
- Anti-racism and anti-trafficking organizations should coordinate cross-border support for victims at Korean institutions, with targeted outreach to students most at risk (women, queer and transgender students, refugees, migrants, and students of Chinese extraction).

Survivors shouldn’t be told to “get over it.” They need institutions to stop enabling it.
