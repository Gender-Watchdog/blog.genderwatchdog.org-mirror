## Error Identification

In our recent email communications to organizations, we incorrectly included a section titled "Corporate Partnership Fraud" that contained unsubstantiated claims about Korean universities' relationships with corporate entities.

## Correction

The section that read:

**Corporate Partnership Fraud:**
- Enhanced institutional rankings and legitimacy through fraudulent partnership claims for corporate relationships
- Created false impression of international business networks and global academic prestige
- Legitimized research collaborations and business relationships based on non-existent international agreements

Should have read:

**International Academic Partnership Fraud:**
- Enhanced institutional rankings and legitimacy through fraudulent partnership claims with foreign universities
- Created false impression of international academic networks and global educational prestige
- Mislead international students about institutional standing and academic cooperation quality
- Used non-existent partnerships to secure government funding and international credibility

## Complete Corrected Section

The entire "Systematic Multi-Level Fraud Operations" section should read:

**Systematic Multi-Level Fraud Operations**

Evidence reveals coordinated deception targeting multiple victim groups simultaneously:

**Government Funding Fraud:**
- Secured government grants and subsidies based on non-existent international partnership agreements
- Obtained funding for international education development programs using fabricated collaboration claims
- Misrepresented institutional capacity through falsified international recognition

**Korean Student Recruitment Fraud:**
- Deceived Korean students about international exchange opportunities and study abroad programs
- Marketed false global networking possibilities and international career prospects
- Collected tuition fees for non-existent international educational services and partnerships

**International Student Recruitment Fraud:**
- Attracted international students through deceptive marketing about institutional legitimacy and partnership quality
- Falsely advertised international recognition, global academic networks, and career opportunities
- Misrepresented institutional standing and international academic cooperation

**International Academic Partnership Fraud:**
- Enhanced institutional rankings and legitimacy through fraudulent partnership claims with foreign universities
- Created false impression of international academic networks and global educational prestige
- Mislead international students about institutional standing and academic cooperation quality
- Used non-existent partnerships to secure government funding and international credibility

This systematic fraud demonstrates how Korean educational institutions may be deceiving multiple stakeholders simultaneously—government agencies, Korean families, international students, and academic partners—while using the proceeds to fund systematic exploitation operations.

## Clarification

Our investigation has focused specifically on **documented evidence of falsified international academic partnerships**, particularly the verified case where a Canadian university explicitly denied having any partnership agreement with Dongguk University despite being listed on their official website.

We have **not** conducted a comprehensive investigation into corporate partnership fraud at this time. Our documentation centers on:

1. **Academic partnership misrepresentation** (documented and verified)
2. **Government recruitment fraud** (documented through archived websites)
3. **Sexual violence cover-ups** (documented through victim testimonies and institutional responses)
4. **Systematic surveillance and retaliation** (documented through analytics and response patterns)
