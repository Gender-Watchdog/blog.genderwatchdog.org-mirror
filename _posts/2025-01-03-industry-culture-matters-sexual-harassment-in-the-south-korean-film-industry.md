### 1\. What Percentage of Women Are Sexually Harassed?

According to the **2019 Korean Film Industry Sexual Violence Survey** (n = 449 women):

> üü• **49.67%** of female respondents reported experiencing **at least one form** of workplace sexual violence in the past two years.

This is **significantly higher** than general workplace harassment rates in South Korea:

  * **61.5% of women** in the film industry had experienced sexual violence at least once (2017 Korean Film Council).
  * By contrast, the rate in public/private companies was only **14.2%**.

### 2\. Correlation Between Higher Education and Harassment

The study reveals a **positive correlation** between **higher educational attainment** and the **likelihood of experiencing sexual violence** ‚Äîcontradicting the assumption that less educated women are more vulnerable.

> üéì Women with a **master's degree or higher** had significantly **higher odds (OR = 3.065)** of experiencing workplace sexual violence than those with only a high school education (p < .05).

#### üìö Theoretical Interpretation

This supports the **Power-Threat Model** , which proposes that:

> "Women with authority, such as those in a higher position, with higher educational attainment... are more likely to be harassed... as a means of protecting hegemonic masculinities or homosocial networks."

In other words, **educated, empowered women** are often seen as threats to **male-dominated environments** and may be targeted in retaliation.

### üîÅ Backlash Effect and Intersectional Risks

Other key risk factors included:

  * **Union membership**
  * **Younger age**

These findings point to a **post-#MeToo backlash** , where women perceived as **feminist or progressive** are **deliberately punished** through sexual violence in an attempt to reassert traditional power hierarchies.
